Computational Thinking
----------------------

What are the skills of reasoning and problem solving in Computer Science and how are computing departments addressing these?


* Computational Thinking
    * Components
        * Decomposition
        * Pattern Recognition/DataOrganisation
        * Generalisation/Abstraction
        * Algorithms
    * Info
        * [BBC Bitesize](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zp92mp3/revision/1)
        * [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking)
        * [Computational Thinking for a Computational World - digitalpromise.org](http://digitalpromise.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/dp-comp-thinking-v1r5.pdf)
        * > When defining what computational thinking is, it is also helpful to establish what it is not: that is, humans thinking like a computer. In fact, it is just the opposite. Computational thinking is a uniquely human ability


Schemes of Work
---------------
Planning for progression - Building schemata

A scheme of work implements a syllabus.

* [Scheme of work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_of_work)
    * > the structure and content of an academic course (syllabus). 
      > It splits an often-multi-year curriculum into deliverable units of work,
    * May include
        * Content
        * Objectives or Outcomes
        * Methods of delivery (student and teacher activity)
        * Assessment strategies
        * Resources

3 Years is a long time - time to forget - revisit topics multiple times over a 3 year period. e.g. Most years have some kind of web work, network work, programming work, etc

Cognitive Load Theory (explored more next session _howStudentsLearn_)
> Working memory should be seen as short term and finite, 
> whereas long-term memory can be seen as infinite. 


### What does a scheme of work look like?

Reminder: 
* KS3 == Year 7 to Year 9 (Level 0 to 1)
* KS4 == Year 10 and Year 11 (Level 1 to 2)

Your familiar with [KS3 Computing National Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study#key-stage-3)

TASK 1: In pairs, compare the KS3 SOW from your schools. (20min)

Make notes on + be prepared to present
1. How do the topics map to the National Curriculum? (is this specified?)
2. What are the links between topics for year 1, 2, 3? 
    * What kind of progression are the creators thinking about?
3. What similarities/differences are there between the schemes of work?

(10min group confer)

TASK 2: Explore other KS3 SOW online (20min)
1. Other than the sequence of content, what other teaching resources are provided?
2. Would you be able to teach any of these units with the resources provided?

### Scheme of work - example
Let's get some hands on!
We are going to explore a sample sequence of lessons

As well as free resources teachers share online. There are also paid for resources. Let's take a look!

        1. To what extent would high-quality textbooks raise the quality of teaching and learning in computing at school?
        2. Is it advantageous to have such books available in physical hard copy?
        3. Is there a shortage of such textbooks?
        4. Where would lack of textbooks sit in a priority list of obstacles to high quality computing education at school?
        5. How can publishers be encouraged to produce materials for teaching computing?
    * Good
        * impact (statistically significant at the 5%)
        * makes authoritative, higher degree of quality assurance.

        * act as the programme of learning
    * Against
        * Outdate (external links)
        * Physical books no active element
        * Requires literacy

Context Based Learning and Relevancy
------------------------------------

If Computing is to be relevant to world they live in, then make Computing encompasses the world. Wherever possible make Computing have _Cultural_ and/or _Community_ context

Young people can smell bullshit. 
Things I try to avoid:
* Fake themes
    * Harry potter tuck shop spreadsheets
    * Ponys
* Try to avoid computer games as a theme
    * These can alienate some demographics immediately
    * > Games are pointless, they don't do anything (for the world)
* Tasks for the sake of a task
    * "Add these number together", "Why", "Because it's the task"
    * (This is less of a problem for A-Level as they have chosen the subject)


* [Pete Dring](https://twitter.com/pddring/status/1405890060013146118)
    * > So proud of Holly and Kiri from @fulfordschool
      > who have just submitted their #MentalHealth app for the @AmazonUK
      > #LongitudeExplorerPrize. Can you spare a minute to vote for LESLI in the people's choice award? https://longitudeexplorer.challenges.org/vote/ 
      > #STEM @Stemettes #Tech4Good #CASChat
    * [longitudeexplorer.challenges.org/finalists-2021](https://longitudeexplorer.challenges.org/finalists-2021/)
        * Living Better: How can technology to help us stay happy and healthy in our day to day lives, and improve the lives of others?
        * Living Greener: How can technology help us protect our planet?
        * Living Together: How can technology help us live together and stay connected in a way that is easy, safe and environmentally friendly?
        * Living Longer: How can technology meet the needs of an ageing society?


### Real World Context for the Pen/Turtle skills learnt above
* Decomposition of geomentirc artwork - cultural context
    * [Theo van Doesburg](https://www.google.com/search?q=Theo+van+Doesburg&tbm=isch) (artist using geometric squares and lines)
    * [Simple Celtic artwork](https://www.google.com/search?q=simple+celtic+artwork&tbm=isch) (circles)
    * [Simple Islamic artwork](https://www.google.com/search?q=simple+islamic+artwork&tbm=isch) (repeating geometric patterns/colors)

By adding context you immediately unlock further computational thinking skills: analysis, decomposition, algorithms

### Relevancy/Context Reading

    * Finance training (understand basic societal economics) classroom economy?
    * Primary source documents
    * Simulate a real-world experience

Metaphors
---------

Physical metaphors are powerful links to the world-view of the student.
Always be 

* Computer Science Education: Perspectives on Teaching and Learning (2018): Sentance Sue, Barendsen Erik, Schulte Carsten
    * Computing can be very abstract subject
        * We can use Metaphors and Analogies
            * Physical tactile manifestation
    * We are trying to build _Competency Model_ rather than _tickbox objectives_
        * _Comprehension oriented_ not _Creation oriented_
    * To plan a lesson: start with _required competencies_ and work backwards from there

DEMO: box's metaphors



Plan a lesson - concept
-----------------------

Are you ready for something cognately HARD ... so far you have been given information .. now it's time to generate it! You don't have enough experience to tackel this yet. It is just an introduction.

Anatomy of a lesson
* previous lesson
* Objectives (what do you want students to learn - not do)
* Entry + task routines?
* Keywords
* Outcome: All/Most/Some?
* Interventions: Indipendent/misconceptions,hurdles/not quite got the core concept
* Differenceiation: stretch the more able, support the weaker
* Transitions (How you move from one mode/task to the next)
* Check their understanding of the task + where the support is
* Plenary
* How will you know they have made progress?

write it, say it to peer, say it to me
hook, storytell
what did we learn last lesson
new material (heres one I made earlyer)
Saffolding and fading (when do you remove the support)

* Starter/Plenary?

How is knowing how computer work worthwhile for these students?

Computer Science is one size fits all - no foundation paper, no double GCSE module.
The paper is science, smart, hard, are you good enough?
