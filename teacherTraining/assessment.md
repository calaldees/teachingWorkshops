Formative Assessment
====================
Carless (2015, p.192) defnes feedback as:
> A dialogic process in which learners make sense of information from varied sources and use it to enhance the quality of their work or learning strategies
Feedback also allows us to align with other practioners
Is everything we feedback on accurate, true, relevent, important - do we talk a lot of shit?
Student don't know what feedback is - so you now need to 'cookie message the shit out of this' "This is Feedback: ....". In emails, in conversations
When students are given feedback - most of them don't understand - get them to reciprocate with their intended actions and why

Good Feedback
1. Timely
2. Facilitates self-assessment
3. Delivers high quality information to students about their learning
4. Encourages teacher and peer dialogue
5. Encourages positivity and self-esteem
6. Helps close the gap between current and desired performance
7. Provides valuable information to teachers

ITT Core Framework
6.1
> Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and needs

6.2
> Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear

6.4
> pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect

6.5
> High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve

6.6
> Over time, feedback should support pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning.

Teachers' Standards
6 - Make accurate and productive use of assessment  
* know and understand how to assess the relevant subject and curriculum areas, including statutory assessment requirements  
* make use of formative and summative assessment to secure pupils’ progress
* use relevant data to monitor progress, set targets, and plan subsequent lessons  
* give pupils regular feedback, both orally and through accurate marking, and encourage pupils to respond to the feedback.

Introduction - Core Formative assessment principles
------------

* EEF [Teacher Feedback to Improve Pupil Learning](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/tools/guidance-reports/feedback/) 2018 - Six recommendations for using teacher feedback to improve pupil learning
    1. SET EXPECTATIONS: Lay the foundations for effective feedback
    2. TIMELY: Deliver appropriately timed feedback that focuses on moving learning forward
    3. PLAN TO USE: Plan for how pupils will receive and use feedback
    4. WRITTEN: Carefully consider how to use purposeful, and time-efficient, written feedback
    5. VERBAL: Carefully consider how to use purposeful verbal feedback
* [EEF Project: Embedding Formative Assessment](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/projects-and-evaluation/projects/embedding-formative-assessment/) Trial 2018
    * Local teaching groups asked to have a range of collaborative sessions address these 5 key points
        1. clarifying, sharing and understanding learning intentions
        2. engineering effective classroom discussions and activities
        3. providing feedback that moves learning forward
        4. activating learners as instructional resources for one another
        5. activating learners as owners of their own learning
    6. CONSISTENT: Design a school feedback policy that prioritises and exemplifies the principles of effective feedback

### Async (1hour)

* From the video answer the following questions (15min)
    * [Dylan Wiliam: What do we mean by Assessment for Learning?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-myBw36_DA) 9min 2018
        * can you elaborate on _students as owners of their own learning_?
        * can you elaborate on _students are learning resources for one another_
        * What does Dylan mean when he says _view from the rear view mirror_?
        * What is the maximum number of times you should perform formative assessment?
* Read this influential paper - (30min reading + 15min notes and thinking about questions)
    * [Inside the Black Box](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/003172171009200119) (Black and Wiliam, 1998) [alternate](https://weaeducation.typepad.co.uk/files/blackbox.pdf)
    * Questions for later in the session
        * How could we train pupils to self assess their work?
            * What skills, support, time, resources would they need to do this?
        * How do we give feedback?
            * what are the benefits/problems of verbal, written, digital?
        * How will students convey their understanding to you?
        * Can you give examples of feedback (phrases/sentences) that would prompt a student to improve? (we will look as group to see if we can wordsmith these)
        * How would you set regular homework + give meaningly feedback (timely) + observe that the feedback was actioned/had-impact


* [Formative assessment, assessment for learning, and all that jazz](https://www.schooleducationgateway.eu/en/pub/viewpoints/experts/formative-assessment-learning.htm) SchoolEducationGateway.eu 2020
    * Assessment for learning (the purpose of the assessment is to promote learning)
        * is any use of assessment that is primarily intended to improve, rather than measure, learning. 
        * If I tell my students on Monday that there is going to be a test on Friday, and the students study for the test, then the assessment is likely to improve the students’ learning, even if I do not actually give the test on Friday. 
        * Testing can also be highly effective as a study technique: as literally hundreds of psychological experiments have shown, taking a test improves learning even if the test is not scored, because it provides practice in retrieving items from memory, which is known to improve long-term learning.
    * Formative Assessment (the results of the assessment need to be used to improve instruction)
        * An assessment functions formatively to the extent that evidence from the assessment is used – by teachers, by students, or by their peers – to make better decisions about the next steps in instruction.
    * ... “formative” and “summative” ... (are)... different kinds of conclusions that might be drawn from assessment outcomes

* 'Formative assessment' should have been called 'responsive teaching' - 'assessment' makes people think of tests - Wiliam

* [Moving from Feedback to Feedforward](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/feedforward/) Cult of Pedagogy 2018
    * Dump the past - embrace the future
    * Feedback - People get defensive about the past

    * What are the 5 key formative assessment strategies suggested by this trial (read the _Full Project Description_; it's hidden!!)
        * We will be working on our own strategies for these points in the session
    * TLC agendas and materials focused on five key formative assessment strategies: 
        * clarifying, sharing and understanding learning intentions
        * engineering effective classroom  discussions and activities
        * providing  feedback - that  moves  learning  forward
        * activating learners as instructional resources for one another
        * activating learners as owners of their own learning 
    * > Within each of these high-level  concepts, the TLC handouts introduced  multiple formative assessment techniques for teachers to consider

* > The additional progress made by children in the lowest third for prior attainment was greater than that made by children in the highest third.
* > The process evaluation indicated it may take more time for improvements in teaching practices and pupil learning strategies to feed fully into pupil attainment. Many teachers thought that younger students were more receptive to the intervention than their older and more exam-minded peers.

TASK:
* Create a heading in the GoogleDoc for each of the 5 areas
* In pairs take two headings (tutor to assign gruops)
* Think about that heading and add some notes to the GoogleDoc (20min)
* Summary as group (15min)

### "Assessment Literacy"
* Students need to know what each of the assessment types are for (summative/formative). They have to see the value.
    * Some students don't see the point in formative assessment (only look at the grade)
    * Some students don't see the point in summative assessment (only care about personal progress and little for the course direction)
    * Some think they know the content already
* Feedback prior to summative assessment is vital

### Bias
* Assessments are a social construct
    * There is bias involved
        * What we think students _deserve_ (antonymous marking is better but sometimes not possible)
    * They are not an exact science

Sync (10min)
* Discuss - how does this technique relate to the EEF 5 key areas?


* > Programming taught from the front of the class at best only ever effectively teaches a third of the class.
* > Allowing students to learn independently at their own pace and choose their own challenges allows greater flexibility for the teacher to stretch and support individual students.
* > students that are absent from class are not disadvantaged and can even continue their work at home. 
* > If a question is too difficult to answer, or a problem is too difficult to solve, these can be left to be discussed with the teacher. The student can still move on to the next objective or problem.



Feedback Cycle and Tools (30min)
------------------------

### Make Students Think

* Below are a list of general feedback and marking techniques that prompt students to engage with the feedback
* Read (7min)
* [10 Feedback Techniques That Make Students Think](https://www.dylanwiliamcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/02/10-Feedback-Techniques.pdf) Dylan Wiliam 2015
    1. Marking for improvement
        * When grading student work, record a grade in your grade-book, but only give students written comments on how to improve. Give students time to read the comments in class and one week to resubmit the work. The final grade is the average of the first and resubmitted grade.
    2. Mastery marking
        * Only accept student work when it is of a specific quality. You might only give one grade, an A. Students are expected to continue to redraft and resubmit their work as many times as necessary in order to achieve an A. The overall grade is then determined by the number of As.
    3. +, –, = (Plus, Minus, Equals) 
        * Mark student work in relation to previous work. If the latest work is of the same quality as the last, it receives an ‘=’, if it is better than the last, it receives a ‘+’, and if it is not as good as the last, it receives a ‘–‘. 
    4. Responding to marking
        * Write your teacher feedback, signed and dated, at the start of the exercise book. Students then make an appropriate response below the teacher feedback, including where to find any redrafting. Do not mark the next piece of work until the student has responded to the last feedback provided.
    5. Focused marking
        * Mark student work against one or two specific criteria, even though there may be many criteria that could be marked. This allows you to provide more focused and detailed feedback on these criteria than if everything was marked. The grade-book contains the skill marked rather than the title of the work set.
    6. Find and fix your mistakes
        * Instead of marking answers as correct or incorrect, tell the students the number of answers that were wrong. Give them time in class to find and correct their mistakes, either individually or in groups.
    7. Margin marking
        * Instead of marking each spelling or grammar mistake on essays, place a mark in the margin. Students then find their own mistakes and correct them
    8. Traffic lights
        * Give students a RED, AMBER or GREEN mark for a piece of work. All RED and AMBER work can be redrafted in an attempt to achieve a GREEN mark. The final grade is calculated from the number of GREEN and AMBER marks
    9. Aim for the next level
        * Students identify areas of improvement by comparing their work to exemplars at the next level of achievement. Students realize that they need to set themselves higher standards. Able students find that they can improve a good piece of work.
    10. Match comments to work 
        * Write comments about students’ work on strips of paper without names. Sit students in groups of four. Each group of four students gets back their four pieces of work and their four comments. The group needs to decide which comment goes with which piece of work.

Consider the question below
* Most of these examples are about a student having a paper workbook (some computing teachers do this!)
    * Can you describe an example of any of these that map to the context of teaching Computing in a digital/remote classroom?


### Feedback Loop/Cycle

* Teacher needs to actively monitor work
    * Students need to know that you care about the work (if you don't care, why should they care)
* Teacher give actionable feedback
* Students needs to digest and then action
* Teacher identify that action has been taken based on the feedback

```

Show you care - two way process

### Discuss tooling and workflows (15min)

* In the context of the modern Computing classroom - how would we accomplish this 'feedback cycle'?
    * How do we quickly comment on students code? and quickly see their progress?

* TASK: What tools could be used to:
    * facilitate this feedback exchange?
    * record this feedback exchange?
    * facilitate the feedback exchange in a timely manner?
        * provide alerts?

### Traffic Light Cups (20min)

In a physical classroom you can visibly see the progress of most students. This takes a lot of expertise and concentration. You need to actively move around the room. Your opinion is not always accurate.

* How will you know how your students are progressing at a glance?
    * You could ask for hands up if you're stuck. This is has a number of problems. Must be responded to timely. No granularity.

* Coloured cups give ongoing feedback - 100% of the time - AMAZING tool!
    * Used when working solo
    * Used when you are demoing
    * Used when in group work
* What they mean is for you to define - clearly!
    * Green: Ok
    * Amber: Bit confused, few bumps, need guidance
    * Red: Blocked
* If any kid loses, damages or gratifies their cup - they loose their ability to feedback

TASK: Read (10min)
* [10 top tips for using traffic light cups to improve assessment](https://www.stmartins.caerphilly.sch.uk/attachments/download.asp?file=1240&type=pdf)
* [Why bother asking students what they think?](https://www.eteach.com/blog/why-traffic-lights-gets-the-thumbs-down)
    * > we can't trust students and they lie for good reasons because they have their own agendas
        * disrupt? duning kruger?
    * > Self-assessment doesn’t help students towards becoming autonomous learners. Self-assessment is more like self-deception. The use of choice cards and traffic lighting doesn't encourage student voice and empower student engagement and learning. It clouds it and muddies assessment.
    * > The teacher is the expert, not the pupil and it's us that makes accurate assessments. 
    * > Self-assessment is about as accurate as peer-assessment. If your mate is assessing you then you'll do well. If it's someone that doesn't, expect a list of critiques.

* Extra point of mine - the struggle IS the learning - If you help every time they are actually making progress you train them to take there agency away.
    * _struggle_ is not the same as _disengaged_ or _blocked_

#### Online?
* In an online context Blackboard has support for this 'status' but it is temporal (will decay after 60 seconds).
* How else could we do this online?

### Async - long form
* What about responses systems in an async world?
* How would the tools be different?
    * Wiki? Forums?



A software idea to support assessment? (15min demo)
--------------------------------------

We are developers. We have the superpower of building solutions. Other teachers can't do this.
We can rapidly prototype ideas. These are sometimes refereed to as _hack projects_.

### Problem

In 2005 I wanted to build a teacher feedback capture system.

I observed that most teacher datasystems required me to sit at a desktop computer and enter data. I needed a mobile/portable data capture system.

### Idea

I wanted a handheld seating plan where I could tap a student and record information. The information was stored and available to the students. I had plans for making that data available as an _active desktop_ so that students logged in an immediately had their progress feedbacks and targets on the desktop.

Laptops were possible but bulky. PDA's were possible, but difficult to program. There were no smartphones. PDA's had VERY limited web ability. I did not have the time to code a system with the limited developer tooling of the era.

The interface would have been complex radio buttons and dialogues. I considered having an audio capture system. By just holding the stylus on a student name I could record audio/voice comments. At least I would have a record. When writing reports or parents evening I could go though all the audio snippets?


### Prototype? 2021

Mobile phones are now prevalent. Speech to text is a service available in HTML5 web browsers (currently only GoogleChrome, more are coming).

I spent 3 hours this holiday making a proof of concept mobile feedback capture system. (1.5 hours was pratting around with web layout ... I'm always on the back foot with web layout, I need to raise my skill-set with it)

* [feedbackLogger](https://calaldees.dreamhosters.com/teaching/teacherTools/feedbackLogger.html) 
    * proof of concept on my webserver
    * it's just a single html file that you can save locally
    * it saves comments in memory that can downloaded as json
    * the seating plan is currently hard coded
    * I've tested it with desktop chrome (It may need a few tweaks to be used on mobile?)
* [github.com/calaldees/teacherTools](https://github.com/calaldees/teacherTools)

TASK: Give it a try
Can we think of any other simple tools that could help us with data management for feedback?
(This leads on to a future session about _Data and Management_)

The important next step would be making this feedback visible to the student.

Feedback Task (1 hour)
-------------

* We've heard about
    * Formative assessment helping the student move on and grow
    * FeedForward (rather than feedback)

* With the extracts of students work provided 
    * (I know this is a slighting different domain to your classrooms, however; students still need to justify their choices and articulate their ideas - e.g. Computers and society, ethics, eSafty, security, impact of AI)
* THIS IS RIDICULOUSLY HARD! Prepare to be overwhelmed by the complexity of the task I'm about to set.
1. (20min) In teams of two or three - Attempt to construct "Marking criteria" for the piece - this will be used by you (teacher) and students to peer assess work
    * Creating clear criteria is hard
2. (10min) Give your "Marking Criteria" to another group - they will mark/grade a piece based on your criteria
    * Using another persons criteria is hard
3. (20min) In pairs - What written feedback would you give to one of these candidates? (you can do more than one, but one is going to be hard enough)
    * Remember 'FeedForward'
    * Creating meaningful, actionable feedback is hard

    * > Student feedback is a contentious and confusing issue throughout higher education institutions. This paper develops and analyses two models of feedback: 
        * > the first is based on the origins of the term in the disciplines of engineering and biology. It positions teachers as the drivers of feedback. 
        * > The second draws on ideas of sustainable assessment. This positions learners as having a key role in driving learning, and thus generating and soliciting their own feedback. It suggests that the second model equips students beyond the immediate task and does not lead to false expectations that courses cannot deliver.
    * Curriculum design
    * Time-on-task, the most thoroughly documented contributor to student achievement (Hattie 2009)
    * > there needs to be a way of detecting that there has been an effect in the direction desired. The cycle of feedback needs to be completed. If there is no discernable effect, then feedback has not occurred.
    * Sadler (1989, 78) to identify three conditions for effective feedback: 
        * (1) student knowledge of the standards that needs to be applied; 
        * (2) having to compare those standards to the students’ own work and 
        * (3) the student taking action to close the gap between the two. 
        * The second and third conditions both require the student to actively engage with the feedback.
    * four characteristics of sustainable feedback:
        1. involving students in dialogues about learning which raise their awareness of quality performance;
        2. facilitating feedback processes through which students are stimulated to develop capacities in monitoring and evaluating their own learning;
        3. enhancing student capacities for ongoing lifelong learning by supporting student development of skills for goal setting and planning their learning and
        4. designing assessment tasks to facilitate student engagement over time in which feedback from varied sources is generated, processed and used to enhance performance on multiple stages of assignments
    * > The sustainable notion of feedback fits well with Barnett and Coate’s (2005) view of the curriculum in higher education as deliberately designed to engage students, among others. They write of
      >> the imaginative design of spaces as such, spaces that are likely to generate new energies among students and inspire them, and so prompt their triple engagement – in knowing, acting and being. (3) [their italics]
      > Barnett and Coate are sceptical of ‘curricula rules and templates’ and of specifying ‘in advance the elements of every programme of study’ (2005, 3). We see the suggestions for feedback here as illustrations of many ways in which the ideas they contain can be manifested, not as the only ways in which they could or should be manifested.
    * It is only through taking a curriculum perspective, which is broader than a learning view or an assessment view, that feedback can be adequately located. Such a view enables feedback to be repositioned away from its taken for granted role as a feature of the ways teachers act towards students, towards being seen as an attribute of the curriculum that locates it as a central feature of student engagement. Feedback becomes therefore a key curriculum space for communicating, for knowing, for judging and for acting. It is not something that teachers do, any more than it is something students do: it is a necessary characteristic of any given curriculum, the effectiveness of which is a key indicator of the effectiveness of the whole course of study.
* [Assessment literacy and student learning: the case for explicitly developing students ‘assessment literacy’](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02602938.2011.598636)
    * > the greatest predictor of enhanced student marks (on the assessment task that was the subject of the experiment), was the development of their ability to judge standards of performance on student work created in response to a similar task. The intervention took just 50 minutes indicating a good educational return on the pedagogical investment.
    * > creating an emphasis on a meta-dialogue about assessment, its purposes and how it functions. A further implication is that gains typically attributable to formative feedback could be enhanced not by a more detailed explication of the feedback by lecturers but rather by deploying assessment literacy (judgement)-enhancing protocols at the formative feedback points during the semester.
    * > Although the gains in student marks were modest in this case, the intervention was extremely brief, just 50 minutes. It is the potential leverage of the development of the ability to judge standards that makes it worthwhile considering incorporating these kinds of assessment literacy-developing protocol into regular teaching practice. In this study the gain was a 10% increase in the marks (approximately 2 in 20) on the task to which the protocol applied.

    * Present policy treats the classroom like a _black box_ and offers no help with as to how to raise attainment. Inputs are money, teachers, resources. Outputs are grades. Whats happens inside the black box?
    * > Feedback to any pupil should be about the particular qualities of his or her work, with advice on what he or she can do to improve, and should avoid comparisons with other pupils
    * > For formative assessment to be productive, pupils should be trained in self-assessment so that they can understand the main purposes of their learning and thereby grasp what they need to do to achieve
    * > Opportunities for pupils to express their understanding should be designed into any piece of teaching, for this will initiate the interaction whereby formative assessment aids learning
    * > The dialogue between pupils and a teacher should be thoughtful, reflective, focused to evoke and explore understanding, and conducted so that all pupils have an opportunity to think and to express their ideas
    * > Tests and homework exercises can be an invaluable guide to learning, but the exercises must be clear and relevant to learning aims. The feedback on them should give each pupil guidance on how to improve, and each must be given opportunity and help to work at the improvement

    * If you don't think you can get better you will reject feedback
    * Create a culture where teachers want to improve - not because they are not good enough
    * Schools are talent refinery's - some kid get it, some kid don't - the good are sifted to the top.
    * Talent incubators or talent factories
    * IQ is 80% of GCSE grade - IQ inhabitability 60%
    * Because it is the case - does not mean it ort to be the case
    * If you get a bell curve - you are not doing your job. A bell curve is what nature gives us
    * I don't want to live in a world where taller people are better at basketball
    * I don't believe in equality of opportunity - because that means the bell curve all over again. We need to give more help to the kids that need it

    * Set's don't seem to impact on achievement - it's not an argument about data, the data is clear - it's about what middle class parents want
    * Some teachers are better than other teacher - so we drive teacher accountability - let's grade teachers - most people cant identify good teachers
    * More struggle more learning - less struggle less learning

        * nobody could tell (Strong 2011) - a coinflip was better odds - school principles, mentors, students, parents

        * If you can add to something without taking away from another - that's a technical matter and you should do it straight away

    * Schools are hyper optimised - everything you do is valuable - so improving education is hard - you can only improve it by stopping people doing good things so that they can do better things - teachers resist change because the things they are doing are good and needed - it's not laziness that _not everything gets marked_
    * SLT should not be advising in breakout groups - they are too detached - they change the dynamic, they are not the ground workers
        * Theory X - people are lazy and leaders need to monitor
        * Theory Y - people are ok and just need support
        * Better to start the conversation with Theory Y - turns out just asking most people to do their best is a pretty good strategy
        * If the metric is just make sales - that's easy - sell everything at a loss and boost sales ... but that's not what we want, we actually want is profit. 
        * We need corporate alignment. Cascaded objectives (OKRs based on OKRs) - direct reports had objectives that are aligned with theirs. 
        * Everybody made/succeeded in their objectives but the organisation did not get better/more-efficient
            * You MUST fail some of your objectives, otherwise they are not challenging enough.

        * Aim to reduce the variation in teacher quality
    * Effective & scaleable teacher professional development

        * It's clear you have to invest in the teachers you've got
    * Formative assessment independent of any curriculum
    * Formative assessment is needed because children do not learn what we teach
    * The most important factor is what the learner already knows. Ascertain this and teach accordingly.

    * Different for every subject and domain
* Formative/Summative
    * Formative assessment
        * Low stakes
        * Only purpose to help improve
    * Summative assessment
        * High stakes
        * The higher the stakes means students will go to great lengths to gain an advantage by cheating
* Types of Assessment Activity
    1.  Traditional Exams
    2.  Short-answer exams
    3.  Multiple-choice exams
    4.  Essays
    5.  Annotated bibliographies

    * Timely
    * Efficient and manageable
        * How long will it take to mark? Is the feedback worth it?
* Something to ponder
    * Should students design the learning outcomes? Or is that just for teachers?
    * If students can select their method of assessment is that more inclusive (essay or poster?)
    * How could you ensure that students understand the marking criteria?
    * Most students don't like formative assessment because it dosnt count
    * Rather than _punishing_ plagerisum. How can students be encaruaged to not want to plagerise?

### Feedback

Student survey "Was your feedback helpful"

* What is it? Can you define it?
    * Communicating how they can improve the quality of their work

* Good feedback
    * Timely
    * Facilitate self assessment
    * Delivers high quality information about their learning
    * encourages teacher and peer dialogue
    * Encourages positivity and self-esteem
    * Helps close the gap between current and desired performance
    * provides valuable information to teachers
        * To improve delivery?
    * How is feedback used?
        * Direct instruction
        * Reflective practice
        * 1 to 1 discussion?
        * 'Feed forward' targeting specific areas for improvement
        * Develops students "appraisal expertise"
        * Include students in the process
            * If feedback is _one way_ students don't take it in. Actively engage students with the feedback.
        * Constructive rather than descriptive
            * Just praising does not help growth mindset
                * "Praise makes you feel good, critique makes you better"
        * Something they got right can be built on
    * Anonymous marking
        * The marker does not have any identifying aspects of the students
    
* Bad feedback

* Principles of assessment design (Gibbs and Simpson, 2004)
    * Number of assessments should be proportional to the amount of study time and love
    * Assessment demands should be designed/communicated so students can allocate time/effort
    * Assessment should engage students in producing learning activity of an appropriate kind
    * Sufficient feedback needs to be provided, both often and in enough detail
    * Feedback should focus on students performance and actions the students can control
    * Timely (the feedback should still matter)
    * Feedback needs to match the grade
    * Feedback need to be actionable




Visible Curriculum - The Education Machine (A historical syndical lens)

Why are you here?
[Teachers' Standards](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/665522/Teachers_standard_information.pdf)

* Help mould young people to be lifelong learners, passionate, self worth, collaborative, community driven human beings

* Can't rely on teachers opinion - no standardisation
* Baseline for comparison across departments/schools/county's
* Evidence based rather than opinion based

* You observe the students - you already know - you know them - you work with 1000's of kids with years of experience. You know. But you need evidence.

* IQ of 86 - Minimum bar for military
    * Under this number there is not a single task that can be given to the individual that is not counter productive.
    * 10% of the population

* Governments 'Value added': +/- from predicted attainment
    * Take Sats (english/maths) estimate IQ
    * Take entire country's GCSE results.
    * Derive average expected GCSE attainment (year 11) from sats (year 7)
    * Apply this derived heuristic to next years cohort (or loosely any future cohort at any yeargroup stage)
* All teachers/departments are ranked in every school.
    * Whether you're told or not; you are ranked.
    * Take a single student
    * Average all their other GCSE's
    * Compare their GCSE average against your subjects attainment +/-
    * Sort the list

* When dealing with averages on this scale, no excuse matters
    * One student had XYZ so they attained poorly. Well averages state another student did better than expected. The world is even. The excuse that a whole class is 'rotten' doesn't hold up against the averages. The weak link is you.

* Schools want this standardised assessment
* Parents want this standardised assessment
* Government's want this standardised assessment

* Teachers in different schools suffer different burdens
    * Ghrama school teachers stating their two level 4's are shameful (one was a school refuser, one had learning difficulty's. The result is still abounding!)
    * Comprehensive school teachers would be overjoyed at 38% of a class attaining level 4

* Cambels law - Any system with a measurable metric is gamed.
* Anything that you do that is not directly related to GCSE metrics (or open evening perception) is pointless.
* SMT Don't know or care.
* If you're _nice_ but don't produce results you'll be seen as a weak practitioner.

* Cash cash cash
    * A-Level class
    * 16 students
    * All predicted E's (because you cant be preicted U's because there is no point in sitting the course)
        * Most students only got 4 GCSE's (in ICT that was 100% coursework), so they take ICT A-Level or Computing A-Level as it' the only foundation skill on paper they have competence in.
    * If they are all predicted U's is this the best choice for this student?
    * Who care's if it's good for the student; every bum on a seat is raw cash baby!!!

* Education is a business
* Welcome to the factory

Every Teacher knows the system is not sufficient - let's not re-enforce that - let's find solutions

Many people have advised governments against this and opinion/process is positively changing
David Didau and Dylan Wiliam + MANY more are inspiring national change


Invisible Curriculum - Character Traits
---------------------------------------

* Draw a picture of a horse as accurately as possible - you will be marked on proportions, feature accuracy, detail - show publicly (5 min)
* Outside (change lesson)
* Write a 3 line poem about Computing. You have (5 min)

Imagine being placed under somebody else's control every 60 minuets and asked to do something that you can't do and then display it publicly and constantly compare you to your peers.

Activity: Why are you here? (Refer to the teacher standards)

* "Everybody is a genius but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live the rest of it's whole life thinking it's stupid" (Albert Einstein)
* "There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men. True nobility lies in being superior to your former self" (Anthony Moore)
* Ken Robinson's Story - Mary - Year 3 - Cold breaktime - drawing God - 'nobody knows what god looks like' - 'they will in a minuet miss' - then the lesson starts, robbed of that freedom.

* The first step is to measure whatever can be easily measured. This is ok as far as it goes.
* The second step is to disregard that which can't be measured or give it an arbitrary quantitative value. This is artificial and misleading.
* The third step is to presume that what can't be measured easily really isn't very important. This is blindness.
* The forth step is to say that that which can't be easily measured really doesn't exist.
(Blatchford 2014)

Activity: Discuss:Some schools ask for an attainment and effort grade? what do you think??

* Brockman story
* Charles Tom story

ITT Core Framework
6.4
> pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect
6.5
> High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve
6.6
> Over time, feedback should support pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning.


#### Assessment Criteria -> Peer/Self Assessment

Activity: "Pupils a can identify a range of web page design features and can explain why the designer has chosen to use them for the target audience"

Publish your assessment criteria
Show examples of good/bad work
They now know + can peer self assess

You see 300+ students a week - you dont have a chance of marking it

Advantages of peer assessment
* stepping stone for self assessment
* less threatening than teacher
* more honest (brutal)
* language more relatable
* more likely to interrupt rather than continue listening to teacher
* different approach angle than teacher


#### Questioning Techniques

Questioning is a form of assessment.

hands up
targeted
pair share
  snowball
round robin
expert groups
Jigsaw (different groups, different questions)
individual whiteboards
Opinion line

        * > We understand that features of working practice, such as collaboration and reference to online coding repositories,would not normally be allowed in exams.Exams are by their nature artificial constructs which allow a particular aptitude to be measured.There are many subjects where the established form of assessment does not reflect how the skills and understanding imparted during the course of study might be used in real-life contexts.Students will, of course, be able to work collaboratively and use online resources as they develop their programming skills.
        * > We also noted the point made by one teacher that assessment by examination is in fact the predominant form of assessment used in recruitment in industry: “Many organisations use only exam assessment to recruit new developers. It is therefore reasonable to assume that similar methods of assessment can be used by the exam boards.”

* See who's falling behind
* Setting targets
* Tracking should be available to you, students, department - How?

* Students should have a habit of evidence gathering - the process is more important than the outcome

* Dictaphone? - how to archive/store? catalog? transcribe?

Activity:
* What data will you track for a class?
* How often?
* How will this data help
    * you? (accountability)
    * students?
    * department?

### 'Cover your ass' case study

* Every practical focused A-Level lesson. Sat one-to-one with student. These are the deadlines you've missed. These are the attainments of your current work. Conversation recorded in database. Key points for improvement. New deadlines for missing work. weekley log of everything agreed with student. They know they have work that is 3 weeks late a letter will be sent home.
* Near end of year a student realised they were really really really behind. Made a sob story about how they were not supported properly and it was the school/teachers fault. Parent goes on warpath. Calls meeting with Head of 6th form and Head of Department and Teacher. Parent ready for a fight. Teacher puts down 5 sheets of A4 with every conversation with the student over the year documented. Multiple letters sent home that 'never got there'. Student frog marched out of room.
* NO Student. However good your rapport with, is your friend. They will turn on you. Your department will turn on you. The only defence you will ever have is assessment evidence and records. They are your lifeline. ALWAYS keep good records.
