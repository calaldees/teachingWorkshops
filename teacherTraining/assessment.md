Formative Assessment
====================

Objectives

* Learning v progress; what does Computing learning look like?
* AfL strategies and feedback to inform subject practice
    * feedback supporting pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning
* Reducing assessment workload
    * High impact high quality feedback

ITT Core Framework
6.1
> Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and needs

6.2
> Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear

6.4
> pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect

6.5
> High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve

6.6
> Over time, feedback should support pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning.


Introduction - Core Formative assessment principles (1.5 hours)
------------

Get a feel for the core concepts of formative assessment

### Async (1hour)

* From the video answer the following questions (15min)
    * [Dylan William: What do we mean by Assessment for Learning?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-myBw36_DA) 9min 2018
        * can you elaborate on _students as owners of their own learning_?
        * can you elaborate on _students are learning resources for one another_
        * What does Dylan mean when he says _view from the rear view mirror_?
        * What is the maximum number of times you should perform formative assessment?
* Read this influential paper - (30min reading + 15min notes and thinking about questions)
    * [Inside the Black Box](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/003172171009200119) (Black and Wiliam, 1998) [alternate](https://weaeducation.typepad.co.uk/files/blackbox.pdf)
    * Questions for later in the session
        * How could we train pupils to self assess their work?
            * What skills, support, time, resources would they need to do this?
        * How do we give feedback?
            * what are the benefits/problems of verbal, written, digital?
        * How will students convey their understanding to you?
        * Can you give examples of feedback (phrases/sentences) that would prompt a student to improve? (we will look as group to see if we can wordsmith these)
        * How would you set regular homework + give meaningly feedback (timely) + observe that the feedback was actioned/had-impact

### Sync (30min)

TASK 1: (5min) In the GoogleDoc create headings for the questions you answerd above - copy and paste ideas from your notes above - put your initials next to your contributions
TASK 2: (25min) Discuss each question - (This will set the stage for some exploration this session)


EEF Trial (1 hour)
---------

* Async - Read (10min)
    * [EEF Project: Embedding Formative Assessment](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/projects-and-evaluation/projects/embedding-formative-assessment/) EEFTrial 2018
    * What are the 5 key formative assessment strategies suggested by this trial
        * We will be working on our own strategies for these points in the session

TASK:
* Create a heading in the GoogleDoc for each of the 5 areas
* Decide as a group - As individuals take a heading each - think about that heading and add some notes to the GoogleDoc (15min)
* Form pairs - critique and refine your two headings (15min) (I will help odd groupings)
* Summary to group (15min)


### Loose notes of mine

* From [The Voices of Solution Tree](https://slideplayer.com/slide/3762685/) - 2011 Dylan Wiliam
* Example Course
    * Weeks 1 to 2
        * Individual choice from a range of work provided by the teacher. Student self-assessment using materials provided
    * Weeks 3 to 6
        * Children construct own problems like those in weeks 1 and 2 and select structured math apparatus to aid solutions
    * Weeks 7 to 10
        * Children presented with a new learning objectives, and make up their own problems, without exemplars by the teacher
    * Weeks 11 to 14
        * Children set their own learning objectives, construct appropriate problems, and use appropriate self-assessment
    * Weeks 15 to 20
        * As weeks 1 to 14, but with less monitoring from the teacher and increased freedom of choice and personal responsibility

How do we train groups to interact?
> We are all better at spotting mistakes in the work of others.

* Activating students as learning resources
    * Students assessing their peers’ work
        * Activating self assessment
            * rubrics
            * exemplars
    * “Pre-flight checklist”
    * “Two stars and a wish”
    * Training students to pose questions/identifying group weaknesses
    * End-of-lesson students’ review

### Make Students Think

* Below are a list of general feedback and marking techniques that prompt students to engage with the feedback
* Read (7min)
* [10 Feedback Techniques That Make Students Think](https://www.dylanwiliamcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/02/10-Feedback-Techniques.pdf) Dylan Wiliam 2015
    1. Marking for improvement
        * When grading student work, record a grade in your grade-book, but only give students written comments on how to improve. Give students time to read the comments in class and one week to resubmit the work. The final grade is the average of the first and resubmitted grade.
    2. Mastery marking
        * Only accept student work when it is of a specific quality. You might only give one grade, an A. Students are expected to continue to redraft and resubmit their work as many times as necessary in order to achieve an A. The overall grade is then determined by the number of As.
    3. +, –, = (Plus, Minus, Equals) 
        * Mark student work in relation to previous work. If the latest work is of the same quality as the last, it receives an ‘=’, if it is better than the last, it receives a ‘+’, and if it is not as good as the last, it receives a ‘–‘. 
    4. Responding to marking 
        * Write your teacher feedback, signed and dated, at the start of the exercise book. Students then make an appropriate response below the teacher feedback, including where to find any redrafting. Do not mark the next piece of work until the student has responded to the last feedback provided. 
    5. Focused marking
        * Mark student work against one or two specific criteria, even though there may be many criteria that could be marked. This allows you to provide more focused and detailed feedback on these criteria than if everything was marked. The grade-book contains the skill marked rather than the title of the work set.
    6. Find and fix your mistakes
        * Instead of marking answers as correct or incorrect, tell the students the number of answers that were wrong. Give them time in class to find and correct their mistakes, either individually or in groups.
    7. Margin marking
        * Instead of marking each spelling or grammar mistake on essays, place a mark in the margin. Students then find their own mistakes and correct them. 
    8. Traffic lights
        * Give students a RED, AMBER or GREEN mark for a piece of work. All RED and AMBER work can be redrafted in an attempt to achieve a GREEN mark. The final grade is calculated from the number of GREEN and AMBER marks.
    9. Aim for the next level
        * Students identify areas of improvement by comparing their work to exemplars at the next level of achievement. Students realize that they need to set themselves higher standards. Able students find that they can improve a good piece of work.
    10. Match comments to work 
        * Write comments about students’ work on strips of paper without names. Sit students in groups of four. Each group of four students gets back their four pieces of work and their four comments. The group needs to decide which comment goes with which piece of work.

Consider the questions below (7min)
* Most of these examples are about a student having a paper workbook (some computing teachers do this!)
    * Can you describe an example of any of these that map to the context of teaching Computing in a digital/remote classroom?
* In the context of Computing and the Context of remote work - how would we accomplish this 'feedback cycle'?
    * How do we quickly comment on students code? and quickly see their progress?

### Feedback Loop/Cycle

* Teacher needs to actively monitor work
    * Students need to know that you care about the work (if you dont care, why should they care)
* Teacher give actionable feedback
* Students needs to digest and then action
* Teacher identify that action has been taken based on the feedback

```mermaid
graph TD
    s[Student]
    t[Teacher]
    t --actionable feedback--> s
    s --action--> t
```

Show you care - two way process

* TASK: What tools could be used to:
    * facilitate this feedback exchange?
    * record this feedback exchange?
    * facilitate the feedback exchange in a timely manner?
        * provide alerts?

### Tools?

* Sync: Discuss tooling and workflows (15min)
    * I've got some ideas ... I'm interested to hear yours
        * git?
        * repl.it?
        * physical workbook?


All student response systems (30 min)
----------------------------

Don't get responses from one student - get from all students all the time

* [Canterbury Christ Church: Classroom Response Systems](https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/learning-and-teaching-enhancement/learning-platform-suite/classroom-response-systems.aspx)
    * Classroom Response Systems (CRS) can allow for polling of student opinions / ideas / resources in or out of the class, usually through the use of an app or web interface.
    * hummm ... not really overly impressive
* [The Classroom Experiment: Dylan Wiliam: All Student Response Systems](https://youtu.be/J25d9aC1GZA?t=1973) 32:53 to 35:10 (2.5min)
    * The principles of whiteboard and traffic light cups are transferable to the digital domain

### Mini Whiteboards

* Physical Mini Whiteboards
    * Advantages
        * Private(ish)
        * Freeform responses
            * Code + diagrams
    * Disadvantages
        * Transient (not trackable)
* Shared Text Chat
    * Advantages
        * Simple
    * Disadvantages
        * Public (could be setup to be one way?)
        * Limited to text
* [plickers.com](https://plickers.com/) (Kind of a QRcode with orientation printed on A4 paper)
    * Advantages
        * Private
        * Trackable
    * Disadvantages
        * Requires technology to participate
        * Limited to multiple choice responses
* [whiteboard.fi](https://whiteboard.fi/)
    * Advantages
        * Realtime
        * Private?
        * Savable
    * Disadvantages
        * Requires technology

### Traffic Light Cups

In a physical classroom you can visibly see the progress of most students. This takes a lot of expertise and concentration. You need to actively move around the room. Your opinion is not always accurate.

* How will you know how your students are progressing at a glance?
    * You could ask for hands up if you're stuck. This is has a number of problems. Must be responded to timely. No granularity.

* Coloured cups give ongoing feedback - 100% of the time - AMAZING tool!
    * Used when working solo
    * Used when you are demoing
    * Used when in group work
* What they mean is for you to define - clearly!
    * Green: Ok
    * Amber: Bit confused, few bumps, need guidance
    * Red: Blocked
* If any kid loses, damages or gratifies their cup - they loose their ability to feedback

TASK: Read (10min)
* [10 top tips for using traffic light cups to improve assessment](http://www.innovatemyschool.com/ideas/traffic-light-cups-to-enhance-assessment-for-learning-ten-top-tips) 2011 blog (by a cup company)

#### Online?
* In an online context Blackboard has support for this 'status' but it is temporal (will decay after 60 seconds).
* How else could we do this online?

#### Purchase Ideas
* Some link ideas from a few mins of searching
    * [Unique-Party-99196-Green-Paper](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Unique-Party-99196-Green-Paper/dp/B01NBSBBFD/)
    * [Beiersi Party Paper Cups 9oz (250ml) Disposable Party Cups,Pack of 10 (Yellow) ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beiersi-Party-Paper-Disposable-Yellow/dp/B076JK46V5/)
    * [PARTY TABLEWARE - Plates/Cups/Napkins/Tablecovers/Bags/Balloons - 8 Colours](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/PARTY-TABLEWARE-Plates-Cups-Napkins-Tablecovers-Bags-Balloons-8-Colours/142262660211?var=441321487781&epid=1605170486&hash=item211f83ec73:g:0jYAAOSw7NNT7GtT)

### Async - long form

* What about responses systems in an async world?
* How would the tools be different?
    * Wiki? Forums?



A software idea to support assessment? (15min demo)
--------------------------------------

We are developers. We have the superpower of building solutions. Other teachers can't do this.
We can rapidly prototype ideas. These are sometimes refereed to as _hack projects_.

### Problem

In 2005 I wanted to build a teacher feedback capture system.

I observed that most teacher datasystems required me to sit at a desktop computer and enter data. I needed a mobile/portable data capture system.

### Idea

I wanted a handheld seating plan where I could tap a student and record information. The information was stored and available to the students. I had plans for making that data available as an _active desktop_ so that students logged in an immediately had their progress feedbacks and targets on the desktop.

Laptops were possible but bulky. PDA's were possible, but difficult to program. There were no smartphones. PDA's had VERY limited web ability. I did not have the time to code a system with the limited developer tooling of the era.

The interface would have been complex radio buttons and dialogues. I considered having an audio capture system. By just holding the stylus on a student name I could record audio/voice comments. At least I would have a record. When writing reports or parents evening I could go though all the audio snippets?


### Prototype? 2021

Mobile phones are now prevalent. Speech to text is a service available in HTML5 web browsers (currently only GoogleChrome, more are coming).

I spent 3 hours this holiday making a proof of concept mobile feedback capture system. (1.5 hours was pratting around with web layout ... I'm always on the back foot with web layout, I need to raise my skill-set with it)

* [feedbackLogger](https://calaldees.dreamhosters.com/teaching/teacherTools/feedbackLogger.html) 
    * proof of concept on my webserver
    * it's just a single html file that you can save locally
    * it saves comments in memory that can downloaded as json
    * the seating plan is currently hard coded
    * I've tested it with desktop chrome (It may need a few tweaks to be used on mobile?)
* [github.com/calaldees/teacherTools](https://github.com/calaldees/teacherTools)

TASK: Give it a try
Can we think of any other simple tools that could help us with data management for feedback?
(This leads on to next session _Data and Management_)

The important next step would be making this feedback visible to the student.

Assessment (Old Notes)
======================

Objective:
* Understand the required formal assessment methods in schools
* Understand the need/techniques for Summative and Formative assessment
* Appreciate the difference between the visible and invisible curriculum

This session fundamentally describes the entire profession.
This is the single most important session in the entire year.

We must deeply internalise and understand the extremes.
We NEED assessment and we NEED humanisation.
We are going to journey through a range of emotions.


Visible Curriculum - The Education Machine (A historical syndical lens)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Why are you here?
[Teacher Standards](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/665522/Teachers_standard_information.pdf)

* Help mould young people to be lifelong learners, passionate, self worth, collaborative, community driven human beings

* Can't rely on teachers opinion - no standardisation
* Baseline for comparison across departments/schools/county's
* Evidence based rather than opinion based

* You observe the students - you already know - you know them - you work with 1000's of kids with years of experience. You know. But you need evidence.

* IQ of 86 - Minimum bar for military
    * Under this number there is not a single task that can be given to the individual that is not counter productive.
    * 10% of the population

* Governments 'Value added': +/- from predicted attainment
    * Take Sats (english/maths) estimate IQ
    * Take entire country's GCSE results.
    * Derive average expected GCSE attainment (year 11) from sats (year 7)
    * Apply this derived heuristic to next years cohort (or loosely any future cohort at any yeargroup stage)
* All teachers/departments are ranked in every school.
    * Whether you're told or not; you are ranked.
    * Take a single student
    * Average all their other GCSE's
    * Compare their GCSE average against your subjects attainment +/-
    * Sort the list

* When dealing with averages on this scale, no excuse matters
    * One student had XYZ so they attained poorly. Well averages state another student did better than expected. The world is even. The exucse that a whole class is 'rotten' doesn't hold up against the averages. The weak link is you.

* Schools want this standardised assessment
* Parents want this standardised assessment
* Government's want this standardised assessment

* Teachers in different schools suffer different burdens
    * Ghrama school teachers stating their two level 4's are shameful (one was a school refuser, one had learning difficulty's. The result is still abounding!)
    * Comprehensive school teachers would be overjoyed at 38% of a class attaining level 4

* Cambels law - Any system with a measurable metric is gamed.
* Anything that you do that is not directly related to GCSE metrics (or open evening perception) is pointless.
* SMT Don't know or care.
* If you're _nice_ but don't produce results you'll be seen as a weak practitioner.

* Cash cash cash
    * A-Level class
    * 16 students
    * All predicted E's (because you cant be preicted U's because there is no point in sitting the course)
        * Most students only got 4 GCSE's (in ICT that was 100% coursework), so they take ICT A-Level or Computing A-Level as it' the only foundation skill on paper they have competence in.
    * If they are all predicted U's is this the best choice for this student?
    * Who care's if it's good for the student; every bum on a seat is raw cash baby!!!

* Education is a business
* Welcome to the factory

Every Teacher knows the system is not sufficient - let's not re-enforce that - let's find solutions

Many people have advised governments against this and opinion/process is positively changing
David Didau and Dylan Wiliam + MANY more are inspiring national change


Invisible Curriculum - Character Traits
---------------------------------------

* Draw a picture of a horse as accurately as possible - you will be marked on proportions, feature accuracy, detail - show publicly (5 min)
* Outside (change lesson)
* Write a 3 line poem about Computing. You have (5 min)

Imagine being placed under somebody else's control every 60 minuets and asked to do something that you can't do and then display it publicly and constantly compare you to your peers.

Activity: Why are you here? (Refer to the teacher standards)

* "Everybody is a genius but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live the rest of it's whole life thinking it's stupid" (Albert Einstein)
* "There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men. True nobility lies in being superior to your former self" (Anthony Moore)
* Ken Robinson's Story - Mary - Year 3 - Cold breaktime - drawing God - 'nobody knows what god looks like' - 'they will in a minuet miss' - then the lesson starts, robbed of that freedom.

* The first step is to measure whatever can be easily measured. This is ok as far as it goes
* The second step is to disregard that which can't be measured or give it an arbitrary quantitative value. This is artificial and misleading.
* The third step is to presume that what cant be measured easily really isn't very important. This is blindness.
* The forth step is to say that that which can't be easily measured really doesn't exist
(Blatchford 2014)

Activity: Discuss:Some schools ask for an attainment and effort grade? what do you think??

* Brockman story
* Charles Tom story

Activity: Board: What are the character traits we want to inspire? Invisible Curriculum (Refer to the Teacher Standards for inspiration).


### Assessing Character Traits and Attitudes (Andrew Hammond)

The 'language' of character

Terms that are rubbish
* soft skills
* progress (end in mind)
* potential (fixed)
* performance (refers to measuring)


'development' implies growth

* Grit
    * gritty, tenacious, committed, courageous, plucky, resolute
* Adaptability
    * adaptable, flexible, accommodating, open, tolerant
* Optimism
    * Optimistic, resilient, positive, confident, enthusiastic, hopeful
* Self-Control
    * Composed, graceful, poised, reserved, in-control, self-directed, self-regulatory
* Empathy
    * Empathic, understanding, considerate, compassionate, kind
* Discernment
    * Discerning, reasoned, rational, responsible, shrewd, astute, grounded, balanced
* Trust
    * collaborative, cooperative, team-player, trusting, participative

'Observable evidence' (not assessment)

Teacher as a model learner
* '6th form complaints about other teacher' story


The Rules?

| Have Courage       | Help others to be strong          |
| Stay positive      | look for the good in others       |
| Show self-control  | Work together as a team           |
| Embrace change     | Help those who find change hard   |
| Believe in yourself | Believe in others                  |
| Respect yourself   | Show respect to others            |
| Do what is right   | Help others to do the right thing |

* If there is a mark in a spreadsheet, markbook, notebook it suddenly has professional weight/value. The knowledge in your head carrys less weight.
* so record it


Learning is something the learners have to do for themselves
Failed a test: Not because you didn't prepare well, it's because your stupid.


Summative/Formative Assessment
------------------------------

* Summative
    * focus is on the outcome
    * gcse result, grade, number
    * no meaningful feedback
* Formative
    * > Any assessment that helps a pupil to learn and develop is formative (Perrenoud) 1991
    * facilitates the participants development
        * corrects a misconception
    * suggestions for improvement, questioning, verbal feedback, self evaluation, peer assessment

Ofsted (historically) wanted to ask students:
* What grade/level are you currently at
* What is there next step. How to improve
    * Target setting is a formalised for of feedback - specific and challenging

ITT Core Framework
6.1
> Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and needs
6.2
> Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear

### Formative

Formative assessment is more effective steaming/setting
* [Inside the Black Box](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/003172171009200119) (Black and Wiliam, 1998) [alternate](https://weaeducation.typepad.co.uk/files/blackbox.pdf)
    * Present policy treats the classroom like a _black box_ and offers no help with as to how to raise attainment. Inputs are money, teachers, resources. Outputs are grades. Whats happens inside the black box?
    * > Feedback to any pupil should be about the particular qualities of his or her work, with advice on what he or she can do to improve, and should avoid comparisons with other pupils
    * > For formative assessment to be productive, pupils should be trained in self-assessment so that they can understand the main purposes of their learning and thereby grasp what they need to do to achieve
    * > Opportunities for pupils to express their understanding should be designed into any piece of teaching, for this will initiate the interaction whereby formative assessment aids learning
    * > The dialogue between pupils and a teacher should be thoughtful, reflective, focused to evoke and explore understanding, and conducted so that all pupils have an opportunity to think and to express their ideas
    * > Tests and homework exercises can be an invaluable guide to learning, but the exercises must be clear and relevant to learning aims. The feedback on them should give each pupil guidance on how to improve, and each must be given opportunity and help to work at the improvement

    * Research suggests consistent effects
    * "Assessment of learning" helps teacher - not learner
    * focusing on the intention rather than the action.
    * "Assessment for learning" strategy by the government is all about recording and reporting achievement - if the impact is not with the student then it's not having an effect
    * > Formative assessment == Such assessment becomes formative  when the evidence is actually used to adapt the teaching work to meet the learning needs (Black 2002)
    * Short term - In the moment - impact before they leave the classroom
    * > Changing what teaching think doesn't benefit students until it changes what teachers do
      > ... we've been trying to get teachers to think there way into a new way of acting. We need teachers to act their way into a new way of thinking
    * Aspects of formative assessment

|-------|----------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Teacher | Clarify and share learning intentions | Engineering effective discussions, tasks, and activities that elicit evidence of learning | providing feedback that moves learners forward |
| Peer | Understand and share the learning intentions | Activating students are learning resources for one another |

    * If you don't think you can get better you will reject feedback
    * Create a culture where teachers want to improve - not because they are not good enough
    * Schools are talent refinery's - some kid get it, some kid don't - the good are sifted to the top.
    * Talent incubators or talent factories
    * IQ is 80% of GCSE grade - IQ inhabitability 60%
    * Because it is the case - does not mean it ort to be the case
    * If you get a bell curve - you are not doing your job. A bell curve is what nature gives us
    * I don't want to live in a world where taller people are better at basketball
    * I don't believe in equality of opportunity - because that means the bell curve all over again. We need to give more help to the kids that need it

    * Set's don't seem to impact on achievement - it's not an argument about data, the data is clear - it's about what middle class parents want
    * Some teachers are better than other teacher - so we drive teacher accountability - let's grade teachers - most people cant identify good teachers
    * More struggle more learning - less struggle less learning

        * If you can add to something without taking away from another - that's a technical matter and you should do it straight away
        * Can we improve education without adding more money?
        * If anything that you add damages what you have - then you are pareto optimal and only more money will improve it

    * Schools are hyper optimised - everything you do is valuable - so improving education is hard - you can only improve it by stopping people doing good things so that they can do better things - teachers resist change because the things they are doing are good and needed - it's not laziness that _not everything gets marked_
    * SLT should not be advising in breakout groups - they are too detached - they change the dynamic, they are not the ground workers
        * Theory X - people are lazy and leaders need to monitor
        * Theory Y - people are ok and just need support
        * Better to start the conversation with Theory Y - turns out just asking most people to do their best is a pretty good strategy
        * If the metric is just make sales - that's easy - sell everything at a loss and boost sales ... but that's not what we want, we actually want is profit.

ITT Core Framework
6.4
> pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect
6.5
> High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve
6.6
> Over time, feedback should support pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning.


#### Assessment Criteria -> Peer/Self Assessment

Activity: "Pupils a can identify a range of web page design features and can explain why the designer has chosen to use them for the target audience"

Publish your assessment criteria
Show examples of good/bad work
They now know + can peer self assess

You see 300+ students a week - you dont have a chance of marking it

Advantages of peer assessment
* stepping stone for self assessment
* less threatening than teacher
* more honest (brutal)
* language more relateable
* more likely to interrupt rather than continue listening to teacher
* different approach angle than teacher

        * > We also noted the point made by one teacher that assessment by examination is in fact the predominant form of assessment used in recruitment in industry: “Many organisations use only exam assessment to recruit new developers.

* Near end of year a student realised they were really really really behind. Made a sob story about how they were not supported properly and it was the school/teachers fault. Parent goes on warpath. Calls meeting with Head of 6th form and Head of Department and Teacher. Parent ready for a fight. Teacher puts down 5 sheets of A4 with every conversation with the student over the year documented. Multiple letters sent home that 'never got there'. Student frog marched out of room.
* NO Student. However good your rapport with, is your friend. They will turn on you. Your department will turn on you. The only defence you will ever have is assessment evidence and records. They are your lifeline. ALWAYS keep good records.

        * measure complex thinking and lower the cost differential because technology-based assessments take less time to score, store and share. 
        * They can enable quick turnaround of assessment data to the instructor and learners, allowing instructors to assess learner performance at a much more granular, detailed level. 
        * they can allow more reliable scoring and valid data interpretation 
    * > CATs are technology-based or online testing systems created by content specialists, psychometricians, programmers and web designers.
      > They contain large test item banks and, when designed well, can attain high discriminating power. They do this through constant calibration or “adaptation.

        * We also expect that innovative CBAfL techniques willmove beyond the laboratory and into the mainstream,and we will no longer have to rely solely on high-staketests for assessing students’knowledge and skills (Shuteet al., 2016a). The boundaries between instruction, learn-ing and assessment will eventually become blurred.

Assessing just the artefact (final code) is not sufficient to understand the process that lead to it.
Sentence says - assess abilities
assess design - assess by interview
