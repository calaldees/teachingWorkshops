    * Traditionally Videoed
    * Feedback from peers and tutor
    * Watch video to enable deeper reflection after comments

    * Some subject have a micro-teach segment each week. Is there value in this?


Forth Wall - Meta Conversation about these sessions
---------------------------------------------------

* Question: Are you happy with the tuition/guidance/sessions?
* What next ...
* Results from observations
    * Goal: Less _instructor lead_ and more _student lead_
    * How?
        * I have readings, resources and knowledge
        * I could ask you to read and discuss, but you would only be discussing new concepts that you don't know much about. Maybe that's the most effective way for you to develop them.
        * Could you cover the depth of the material on your own?
        * Do you want pre-session prep to do to leverage session time? (do you want more work?)
        * Am I delivering world class teaching? What would world class look like?
        * Your student evaluations at the end of the year are the yardstick
        * Criticality: Asking students what they like is not always the best measure. Students enjoy watching videos and eating ice cream, doesn't mean that leaning is happening.
