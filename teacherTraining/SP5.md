### PGCE SP1 Assignment

* [Blackboard Assessment](https://learn.canterbury.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_3144032_1&course_id=_17983_1&mode=reset)
* [Subject Pedagogy Research Proposal: Microsoft Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=2rIgA90iq02MIW5kS6FPE4bZosdBzY5AvRurHpjUivVUQ0JRMFNOREUwNlBTVkxLREQ5UDFQVDVaRC4u)
    * Area of the investigation - Keep this quite broad
    * Key reading related to the area - Outline at least three or four key texts that you have looked at for this. Ideally, this should include specific research articles
    * Focus of the area of enquiry/specific research question - What is the precise question or key issue that you wish to explore? Can you phrase it as a research question?
    * Possible ethical issues - The key ethical issues are informed consent, protection of children, anonymity and confidentiality, and payment of research participants. In the case of a literature review, as you are only using secondary data and that there are no participants involved, ethical clearance is not required. However, it is good practice to make a general statement to show that you have considered ethics in light of the research you are carrying out.
* Can only mark with a draft of 10% - 200 words

### PGCE Microteaching for SP7

* You are to plan a 15min mini teaching session
* You will deliver this in SP7 to peers
* The session can be on any KS3 or KS4 topic
* Assume your audience are school age (there will be no simulated behavioural issues)
* The students should do something active
* Feedback will then be given by peers/tutor
* Hopefully you can practice in a safe environment
