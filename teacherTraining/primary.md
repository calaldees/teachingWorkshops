Computing in Primary Schools
============================

Objectives:
* Explore the primary national curriculum for computing
* Be familiar with how the approach to teaching computing in primary differs from secondary
* Consider how this knowledge will influence your planning and understanding of KS3

Disclaimer:
* I'm not a primary school teacher ... I don't have first-hand experience of the area ... however ...
* I am interested in the topic and spent time reading articles, talking to actual primary teachers, watching videos, buying books and exploring software
* This session is an open discussion of what I've found so far
* Let's use this time to explore the topic

    * We will discuss your findings


National Curriculum
-------------------

* Historicity
  * ICT
  * The curriculum used detailed _levels_
  * Teachers were expected to
    * assess sublevels, progression, marking, evidence
  * This was too heavy, too prescribed
  * [the state of the nation - CAS Community 2009](https://community.computingatschool.org.uk/files/6714/original.pdf)
    * Only 4700 students nationally enrolled on A-Level Computing
* Now
  * It's a couple of bullet points on 1 page of A4

* Statutory guidance [National curriculum in England: computing programmes of study](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study)
  * The statutory programmes of study and attainment targets for computing at key stages 1 to 4.

Categorise the bullet points
Comments? How does this compare/link with KS3/KS4?

Ofsted Inspections
------------------

* To my knowledge; no school has failed an Ofsted inspection because of poor Computing.
  * Until a school fails with this criteria, the focus will always be on English/Maths
* [iCompute-and-Ofsted](https://www.icompute-uk.com/Downloads/iCompute-and-Ofsted.pdf) - Questions Ofsted will ask primary practitioners
  * e.g.
    * What practices do you use in computing to build new knowledge?
      * unplugged and PRIMM

Activity: What's in an Ofsted report? (10min + 5min)
* https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/
* Find a feeder primary of your placement school
* Search for the term 'computing' or 'ict'. Can you find it mentioned in the report?


Case Study: Average unnamed primary school
------------------------------------------

* Computing was allocated 1 hour a week
  * Computing was always the first subject to be dropped
  * Canceled once every 2 weeks - christmas play, other activities

* Computer rooms
  * One computer room for a small school
    * A shared resource was often kept in a poor state
      * Many machines broken because lack of individual responsibility
      * Much time spent moving children to different machines (adding to teacher/pupil frustration)
  * No in-house technician - An external tech visited once a week
    * Installing new software often a blocker/problem

* Timing of the hour a week lesson
  * 10min transport/travel to computer room
  * 10min to log in (an alien concept for most children)
    * Most forget password - password barrier to entry - their computers at home don't have them
      * Have password written in planners
        * forget planners
        * cant read back writing
    * Many technical issues (see above)
  * Only 30min max of actual teaching
    * Demoralized: Why interact with computer after 20min of pain to get there

Discuss: Could facial recondition be used to speed-up login? Good or bad idea and why? Is this legal or not legal?

* Mobile computer-room - Tablet trolley
  * Using computers in the style that young people can understand
  * Apps for coding on iPads

* Confused by desktops
  * Turning monitor on is turning computer on !!?!
  * No desktop at home
    * No understanding of keyboard and mouse
      * Poor motor control

* Staff Digital Literacy
  * Very low - average people can't really use computers effectively

* Resources and planning
  * Most lessons are 'read from script'
    * difficult for teachers to resolve problems as they don't have the depth of understanding
      * Teachers told solution but cant debug
        * Often quote "Let's start again" as the only way forward
      * Most children are left unguided
  * Lesson schemes of work are often paid bundles with web resources
    * Lesson activities are web based (no need to install anything)
      * Extra layer of logins (machine login and website login)
  * Solving the access to computers/software
    * Website - all in one resources
      * Students struggle to type urls (combination of case and strange symbols)
      * Sites have different username and different password - more blockers

* Reporting
  * No reporting of grade specific to computing
    * very soft data
      * "doing well in geography and history, struggling in french"
  * No assessment of computing
    * Most marking maths english every day - just AfL
  * Daily possibility of catchup with parents as children are collected
    * Nod/Wave
    * Normally chat about behaviour if needed
      * (Side note: anonymity in secondary school is problematic)
    * Lots of verbal feedback with teacher and parents
      * "really good at computing"

* A few pupils will be very capable
  * Because they are personally exited about computing - doing it at home

* Behaviour
  * "Don't shake the screen"
  * Throw mouse at screen

This school was reported 'Good' by Ofsted.
Computing does not get mentioned in the inspection report.


Discussion: (This is not a fair or representational study of all primary schools). From your observations and knowledge, what do you think is the state of Computing in primary education?
10min?

Some primary schools are the opposite - put our secondary KS3 progress to shame ...

Structured time?
----------------

* Computer room is often used for for unstructured homework

In the context of primary education ...

(10min)
Discussion: With such rigorous goals for the whole of the education system. Is there any value in letting young people _explore_ computers? They don't use keyboards and mice at home. Just let them use paint. Click on a few bits. Just have time on one.


CAS Primary Guidance
--------------------

[CAS Primary Computing](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk/data/uploads/CASPrimaryComputing.pdf)
* Here are a few examples of projects.
  * Making and editing a cookery video in which the algorithm of a recipe is clearly illustrated.
  * Creating a video game using characters and settings from a shared reading book.
  * Developing educational software for younger pupils to practise mental arithmetic.
  * Creating a scripted or stop-motion animation telling the story of an emailâ€™s journey from sender to recipient.
  * Adding content to the Simple English Wikipedia to explain computing concepts (or concepts from other topics pupils are studying) to a global audience.
  * Developing a micro-site for the school on how to use the web safely, respectfully and responsibly
* Using a pupil-centred approach
  * Modular projects for pupils to choose from
  * Use an enquiry-based approach at the beginning of each half-termly unit:
* Recommends
  * [OpenBadges.org](https://www.openbadges.org) by Mozilla
    * Concept is suitable for _formal_ and _informal_
    * An image with json/metadata encoded in the image. Cryptographically signed by issuer.
    * [issuing](https://www.openbadges.org/get-started/issuing-badges/)
  * Historically highlighting female computing icons

### Resources

Book Exploration/Review
-----------------------

### Book: Teaching Primary Computing (Martin Burrett)

Year 1: (Age 4)
* Moving a sprite in scratch
* Image manipulation
  * Hue shift
  * Cut paste

Year 6: (Age 10)
* App design
  * http://appshed.com/
* Game design (and make it)
  * title screen
  * game over screen
  * design levels
* Edit videos
  * Make documentaries/advert
  * Chroma key backgrounds

#### My comments/observations

Given that year 1
* can't read
* can't easily use a keyboard and mouse
* get sporadic access to a poorly maintained computer room
Is scratch programming realistic?

The Year 6 projects listed here are something that I wish GCSE students could do.

All tasks are project based (computing is a taught as part of an integrated curriculum).

### Book: Primary in action (Yasemin Allsop and Ben Sedman)

Every Chapter by a different specialist
Good chapter on assessment

* Embedding computing in science - data loggers
* Linking maths to computing - spreadsheets, graphs, geometric shapes (turtle)
* Imagine write and share. Blogs wikis and web design
* Plastercine - stop motion
* Voice over video footage
* QRCode treasure hunt

#### My comments/observations

* Each chapter has a clear focus
  * Written by a specialist
* The tasks are challenging, but realistic
* Teachers need
  * time to
    * fully understand the tools/components/software/hardware
  * reasonable money for resources

All tasks are project based (computing is a taught as part of an integrated curriculum.


Hardware

Massive money making industry.
Companies created and going bust regularly.
Technology obsolete regularly.
BETT is full of this stuff

Blogs/Wikis
-----------

All pupils are encouraged to publish something online that is publicly visible as part of a school project.

Publicly visible gives something tangible for friends and family.

* [WikiSpaces](https://www.teachhub.com/technology-classroom-alternatives-wikispaces)
  * Class recipe wiki
  * Clear rules (never surname, never identifiable details)
* Blog

Assessment
----------

* Page of A4 with template for term
  * badges the teacher has given
  * I can
    * mini description of task they did in a lesson
  * vocab box
  * problem -> how you solved it


eSafety
-------

Visited every year as part of the curriculum.

* Year 1: Starts of with categorizing information
  * Something most people know
    * I go to this school
  * Something my friends know
    * I like cheese
    * I went swimming last weekend
  * Something me or my family know
    * I had a nightmare about monkeys
* Year 1/2/3 told about stranger danger (not the darker side of communicating online)
* Year 4/5/6 told about online etiquette/dangers

Possible primary activity:
* Teacher loads up a chat window on the projector
* As a class they have a text based conversation with a 'child in other school'
  * Has an avatar of something popular with the kids
  * Posts silly funny gifs
  * Names characters from a TV show and which ones they like
* At the end of the conversation a teacher/support-assistant from another room enters and reveals they were pretending to be a child from another school all along.
* Discuss what this means


Unplugged
---------

[unplugged](./unplugged.md)

Many primary school activities talk about 'giving instructions to a person' to perform a dexterous task (such as 'Make Tea') and help pupils decompose and frame instructions.

Primary to Secondary Transition
-------------------------------

The transition of primary/secondary is jarring and difficult.
* The anonymity
* The style of work
* The student/teacher relationship
It's often observed that pupil performance dips when entering secondary school.

* [Ofsted: Key Stage 3: the wasted years?](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/key-stage-3-the-wasted-years) 2015
  * the quality of teaching and the rate of pupilsâ€™ progress and achievement were not good enough.
  * Key Stage 3 is not a high priority for many secondary school leaders in timetabling, assessment and monitoring of pupilsâ€™ progress.
    * As a result, some Key Stage 3 classes were split between more than one teacher or were taught by non-specialists.
  * Leaders prioritise the pastoral over the academic needs of pupils during transition from primary school.
  * Many secondary schools do not build sufficiently on pupilsâ€™ prior learning
  * Careers education, information, advice and guidance (CEIAG) in Key Stage 3 is not good enough
  * too many secondary schools did not work effectively with partner primary schools to understand pupilsâ€™ prior learning and ensure that they built on this during Key Stage 3.

* [What Makes a SuccessfulTransition from Primary toSecondary School? - Research Report DCSF-RR019](https://dera.ioe.ac.uk/8618/1/DCSF-RR019.pdf) 2008
  * 84% said they felt prepared on entry to secondary school
  * only 3 per cent of children were worried or nervous a term after starting their secondary school.
  * A successful transition for children involved
    * developing new friendships and improving their self esteem and confidence
    * experiencing curriculum continuity
  * The most successful schools, as identified from the case studies, were those with very close links and co-ordination between primary and secondary schools.
  * Teachers reported wanting more information and a better understanding of the different approaches to teaching between primary and secondary schools.

### Integrated Curriculum

> An integrated curriculum allows children to pursue learning in a holistic way, without the restrictions often imposed by subject boundaries.

### CBIC - Competency Based Integrated Curriculum

#### Case Study 1 - Primary

An experienced primary teacher trainer commented about a year 6 animation project.
They created animations and hired a cinema to showcase them to all students and parents.
He was consulting with a secondary school about their year 7 computing/ict provision.
The secondary school were going to start them off with really simple animations.
The primary trainer commented that students would be board very quickly.

Given the power of project based approaches and the power of spending multiple weeks on a topic to bring a skill to a sufficiently high level. 
We then start secondary school but splitting that up into tiny fragment box's that get 1 hour a week.

#### Case Study 2 - Secondary

See CBIC or Integrated Curriculum in secondary (from earlier sessions)?

Integrated curriculum - a case study in secondary.

Activity: Given the benefits in primary. Do you think this would work in secondary? (10min)

Story
* Sandwich Technology School in 2008/201x tried this.
  * Over half of contact time in CBIC group
  * Total unmitigated failure
    * Pupil disengagement
      * They came here exited to be taught be specialists and they were treated like baby's. It was worse than primary school.
    * Weaker teachers that couldn't teach the higher levels of their subjects were given groups
    * Class's were huge 60 person classrooms with 2 teachers
      * Utterly impossible to concentrate
      * So much noise


Innovative KS3 Lessons
----------------------

* Captain Callaghans treasure hunt
* Barcode project
* River valley

* Paper plane boomerang
  * reverse engineering

What now?
---------

Discuss:
* Now we know about primary schools.
* What is this going to change about your secondary teaching?


Conclusions
-----------

* Give year 7's more support
  * With the understanding of year 6's
* Trained 7-14 practitioners for all subjects could help the transition to secondary
* Because primary schools have more contact time with a class, they can craft more cross curricular and integrated project based work
  * Secondary teaching feels anonymous and fragmented in comparison

CPD: Set a target of having one day in primary in the summer term each year. Talk to the primary teachers. Network with them. Understand your primary feeder schools.
