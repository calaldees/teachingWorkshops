Important Subjects?
-------------------

Let's get some perspective - where does Computing fit in?

DISCUSS: Verbally Justify why each of these subjects is important
* English
* Maths
* RE
* Physics
* Chemistry
* Biology
* Geography
* History
* DT
* PE
* Social Science
* Business Studies
* Drama

and now

* Computing

We are a tiny part of something much bigger.
Our subject may seem insignificant. Or it may be the most important of all.
Which is it?


Or maybe there are no subjects? They are just a societal construct?

What subjects are studied at Eton?
Which would you choose for a curriculum?



What is the National Curriculum? (15min)
--------------------------------

The subjects have been chosen by government policy.

* [Curriculum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum) Wikipedia
    * > Curriculum is broadly defined as the totality of student experiences that occur in the educational process.
    * > The term often refers specifically to a planned sequence of instruction, or to a view of the student's experiences in terms of the educator's or school's instructional goals

The entire roadmap for state education.

* [Statutory guidance - National curriculum in England: framework for key stages 1 to 4](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-framework-for-key-stages-1-to-4/the-national-curriculum-in-england-framework-for-key-stages-1-to-4) 2014
    * Computing is a Foundation subject
    * Academies/Public/Private/Independent don't need to teach computing

TASK: Read the National Curriculum (10min) Make notes in shared document about the things you as a Computing teacher need to actively engage with.
(5min summary with class)





National Curriculum - Computing (30min)
---------------------------------------

### What is Computing? (20min)

* [National Curriculum: computing programmes of study](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study) 2013
    * The opening line ... is majestic!
    * > A high-quality computing education equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world.

TASK: Read it ... (5min) ... first impressions (5min)?

* Computing at School [Computing in the national curriculum: A guide for secondary teachers](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk/data/uploads/cas_secondary.pdf) 2014
* [Fulford School: What is Computing](https://fulford.york.sch.uk/computing/) P. Dring
    * 82% of all job vacancies require digital skills
    * Roles requiring digital skills pay 29% more than those that don’t
    * In recent years, the number of digital jobs grew almost three times as quickly as other occupations
    * 3 strands
        * Computer Science (CS)
            * involves understanding how computers work and how to use them to solve problems with algorithms and code.
        * Information Technology (IT)
            * involves processing data and using a variety of hardware & software to create digital media that is suitable for different audiences and purposes.
        * [Digital Literacy](./digitalLiteracy.md) (DL)
            * involves understanding how to use technology safely, respectfully, responsibly and securely

TASK: Look at the National Curriculum and categorise the points into the table below (pairs?) (10min)

* [National curriculum in England: computing programmes of study](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study#key-stage-3)

| Computing | ICT | DigitalLiteracy |
|-----------|-----|-----------------|
| | | |

ANSWERS: As a group, Let's compare against CAS allocations - where are your misunderstandings?


### Is the National Curriculum out of date? (10min)

The NC was written in 2013. Computing moves so fast, does it need to be re-written?
(If the answer is 're-write', would a single student have ever completed the NC from KS1 to KS4?)

TASK: Read the NC. Where could AI fit in? (Hint: It IS in there ... but where?)


Science Vs Engineering
----------------------

* [Computing Science or Engineering? Language](https://learn.canterbury.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-2641367-dt-content-rid-3959384_1/courses/E20MTETT4SPD/Is%20Computer%20Science%20a%20Science%20-%20Denning.pdf) Interview with Denning 2007
    * > Because computers are man-made and not natural. We can't study them like a science. People in other fields think we are just programmers. We've be unsuccessful in communicating the breath and depth of our discipline
* [Knowing versus Doing: Academic and Vocational Education for Informatics in the UK](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.103.7746&rep=rep1&type=pdf) Cowling 2000?
    * vocational (ie concerned with developing skills),
    * academic (ie concerned with developing knowledge) 
    * What if what we do needs both? These have converged.
    * > neither kind of course (academic or vocational) can be characterised simply in terms of equipping students with knowledge or skills.

* Most Computing teachers have not come from a Computing background. They have come from other subjects.
* 2014 All _ICT teachers_ in the country were told "You now teach Computing".
* The first GCSE computing students have been though university and are now entering the workforce 2021

WE WON!! WE GOT COMPUTING ON THE CURRICULUM!
... but you know where this goes ... you've done the pre-reading ... there is a backlash

TASK: From today's session. 
1. Reflect on "clear vision about what education is for"
2. Articulate how this will impact your teaching (actions/next-steps)
5min thinking/preparing.
Round-robin the group. 


Closing thoughts
----------------

### Access to information


* We dreamed of a future where everyone had access to information. It would liberate the working class's.
* We now have access ubiquitous to high quality information: YouTube, Learn-to-code resources, Wikipedia.
* Is the average person smarter, better informed, more skilled?
* The problem is not _access to information_.

### What are the expectations/misconceptions teaching Computer Science?

* "Young people are so good. All that clicking around so fast"
* "I'm not going to be a software developer this is pointless"

* Actually work with data
* as

More
* Perceptions of gender and ethnicity in Computing



### Explore the backlash and confusion about computer science in education and wider society

National Curriculum Assessment
------------------------------

TASK: The National Curriculum is a page of A4? How would you report a grade to your school and to parents?
Discussion

(Many people have spent 100's of hours deliberating over mechanisms to do this. I'm asking you, as beginners to do this in 10min. It's a deliberately overwhelming task to get you to understand the magnitude of the problem)


"How do you report grades/progress in KS3" - however you like - it's the wild west!

Some just use GCSE grades for KS3. This is not what GCSE grades were designed for - there is some missing overlap KS3/KS4

School inspection criteria for Computing (10min)
-----------------------------------------

Copy paste from
[computingAcrossCurriculum.md](./computingAcrossCurriculum.md) #Ofsted and Computing (how link to heading?)

From Ofsted Education Inspection Framework

* Teaching in computing is good or better when:
    * it is rooted in the development of pupils’ understanding of important concepts and progression within the lesson and over time; it enables pupils to make connections between individual topics and to see the ‘big picture’
    * teachers use a very wide range of innovative and imaginative resources and teaching strategies to stimulate pupils’ active participation in their learning and secure good or better progress across all aspects of the subject.
* The computing curriculum is good or better when:
    * the contexts in which computing is taught are relevant to pupils’ lives and reflect the increasing use of computing in the world of industry
    * excellent links are forged with other agencies and the wider community to provide a wide range of enrichment activities to promote pupils’ learning and engagement with the subject
    * links with other subjects in the school are productive in strengthening pupils’ learning in computing
* Leadership of computing is good or better when
    * there are effective strategies to delegate subject responsibilities where appropriate and to share good practice
    * computing has a very high profile in the life of the school
* Finally ...
    * E-safety is now considered in the inspection of all education remits including the early years sector, further education and skills, and initial teacher education.

Hummm: I can't see much in this that prescribes computing as a standalone subject?
THIS IS IMPORTANT!!
