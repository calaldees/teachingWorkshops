Space to try things their own way and come to their own conclusions
Sometimes have to say hard things

mentoring? -> coaching?
coach has some some great questions for your answers
mentor has some great answers for your questions

skilled in deconstructing and explaining their practice
outstanding teachers are not nesisarilly outsanding mentors
carter review 2014

concious competence == saying "mirror signal manurer"
unconcious incompitence == you just drive? really need to think about the steps

They may want to bury the failure - you must help them unpick it


co-observe a lesson - prompt the student with what to look for
oberve a sequence of lesson
observe (with a focus)


Meeting record done by the student - you sign it off each week
The weekly meeting is the most important moment of the week
Left hand side
 Review targets from previous week
 3 Targests for this week (there will be more, but whats most urgent)
    specific, mesurable, A, R, T
 eventually these targets will be pupil progress targets
 (support they need - not nessisrally mentor, point in right direction)
Right hand side is reflections
 how week, well, not well, why
 rolfs model - what _so what_ now what
 kolb reflection, theorising, expeimenting, experience (advanced)

If they have the same target every week this may be alarm bells

One formal observation each week
 * lesson plan (provided by student) on CCCU proforma (in advance? 24h?)
    * give them a focus for you observations (linked to targets from weekly meeting?)
 * your observations form - ask them 'how do you think it went?' - limit what you share, 2 or 3 prioritys
    * who was most engaged? who was not engaged?
 * evaluatiion (by student)
Move beyond _just descriptions_ - move towards analysis/evaluation _why_s

practical working documents - not perfect masterpeices

When they hit a low patch - go back through the older weekley meetings to show progress

observe other subjects

You are a pivotal character in their career

Subject: Placement visit for School Direct Computing

Dear Colleagues,

Thank you for hosting our Computing student on their training placement on the School Direct programme.
I hope that despite all the complexities presented by the start to this academic year, things have settled down for you and you feel you have established a positive working relationship with your student.

My purpose in writing now is to inform you that I wish to set up my first (virtual) placement visit at a mutually convenient time in the next few weeks.
Just to give you the background to this, each student is allocated two visits over the course of the year, as well as a slot in the summer for the final assessment.
As you can imagine in the current circumstances, these visits will take place online until further notice and I would like to suggest that we use Microsoft Teams for this purpose. 
(Microsoft Teams can be accessed through any web browser as a guest).
As I have a number of upcoming PGCE visits, it would be most convenient if I could complete this first set of visits by mid November.

I want to emphasise that the role is my visit is purely to be supportive of you in your role as mentor to ensure that the student has the best possible training experience this year.
As you may be aware from communications with the University, the focus of the placement visit is now very much on using this time to work directly with the Subject Mentor, rather than working with the student directly.

-- Visit breakdown --

The visit itself should last around two hours.

I would like to spend the first 30 minutes of this time meeting with you as the Subject Mentor to explore the approaches that you have taken in mentoring your student thus far. 
To facilitate this discussion, I would like to draw your attention to the extract of the "Partnership Evaluation Framework" document attached.
This lists the areas that are key to successful mentoring and will act as a focus for our discussions.

What we do in the second hour will depend upon the model of visit that you chose. 
For this I draw your attention to "Subject Mentor - Tutor visits and support F&M model 2020-21.pdf" attached. 
This document describes the five stages of student teacher development as suggested by Maynard & Furlong (1995) and links these to possible development activities to support their training. 
In planning for the visit, I would therefore ask that you consider the stage of development at which you feel your student teacher currently sits (likely to be 1, 2 or 3) and which of the linked activities (on pages 5-11) would be the most appropriate to meet the training needs of both of you as mentor as well of those of the student teacher at this point in time.
The development activity that we undertake during my visit will therefore depend on where we feel that the student is at this stage in their professional journey.
I would suggest that the student joins us for this part of the visit.

I can then spend the final 30 minutes of the time allocation in discussion with the student.

It might also be appropriate for the Professional Mentor to join the conversation at some point during the visit, but this is not mandatory.

-- Dates --

I have listed below the dates when I am currently available to make this virtual visit.
The dates and times I currently have free are:

Monday 2nd November - at any time
Tuesday 3rd November - at any time
Wednesday 4th November - at any time

Monday 9th November - at any time
Tuesday 10th November - at any time
Wednesday 11th November - 9am to 12pm
Friday 13th November - at any time

Monday 16th November - at any time
Tuesday 17th November - at any time

In the light of the information above, I would be grateful if you would reply to me to indicate the following:
 - when, from the list above, might be a good time hold this virtual visit (we ideally need a 2 hour slot)
 - where you think your student might currently sit on the five stages of development as described by Maynard & Furlong
 - an indication of how you might like to make best use of the joint activity with the student with reference to those suggestions in visit-support pdf.

Given that I have sent this information out to all mentors in this first tranche of visits at the same time, I will "take bookings" (so to speak) on a first come, first served basis, so it would be prudent to respond to me at your earliest convenience to reserve a slot.

--

I look forward to coming into school and working with you in due course.

Kind regards,

Check-list
----------

Checklist for autumn term visit in Computing 2020

Note that much of this should arise naturally from the initial conversation with the mentor.
However, it should also cover the agenda points listed below.

Maynard and Furlong Level
Know what we are covering in uni weeks
Is mentoring collaborative (2way)
Is mentor ok - is student ok

## In conversation with the curriculum mentor
* Hi - Who are you background? Who am I?
* Previous experience of mentoring and the extent to which the mentor has been trained
* Explain the rationale for the visit being mentor facing (training visit and QA)
   * Enhance the work you (as mentor) are already doing
   * What lies at the heart of mentoring? (coach - two way - they come to right answer themselves)
* The timetable that they have devised for the student (check it provides coverage of both KS3 and KS4 and ascertain if access to KS5 is at all possible).
   * When is the weekly mentor meeting?
   * are they observing other subjects? (ongoing?)
* Explore the mentor’s knowledge of the Curriculum 2020;
   * What do mentor meetings look like? targets together? specific nature of targets (e.g. calm students down)?
   * Weekly sheet?
   * How are they implementing it?
   * Are they aware of the 10 key questions?
* The timing & regularity of the mentor meeting and the approaches taken/meeting content
* The use being made of the weekly record of mentor sheet and how the weekly targets are being arrived at. 
   * Possible QA of examples if available.
* Mentor engagement with the Subject Knowledge Tracker 
   * (using it to help set weekly target linked to Subject Knowledge Tracker)
* Engagement with workload reform; the fact that student teachers are no longer expected to develop their own lesson plans from scratch; are resources/lesson plans being shared so the student can adapt them for their own teaching?
* QA of any lesson observations forms that have been completed to date. Explore "lesson packs" (20 for year, scaled graduated)
   * Plan (student)
   * Observation (mentor)
   * Evaluation (student?)
* Explain that the grading system is changing; no grading against the Standards; just the need to meet them holistically by the end of the programme; way stage checks will be in place
* Where is the student on Maynard and Furlong?
   * What are the students strengths? Next steps for development?
   * On track? or Not on track? (support for student)
* Any action points that arise from the above
   * Any questions?
   * How can I help?

* Mentor Report? (Investigate) Before christmass
* ?
   * (Engagement with the mentor element of the PEF – have they undertaken any self-assessment?)

* 2nd meeting? Date? March? April?


## Mentor meeting observation
* differentiation?
   * differnet responses? peer?
* assessment?
* Timing? starter? pleaneray? (student timekeeper?)

differentiation - who the stuents you consider and why?
targets?
Who can you push in this group? next step? - What are you going to do for these more able pupils?
'single them out' or 'publicly' could be problematic - how subtely do this?
Who is struggling? next step? what might a scaffold like for that task? highlight relevant words rather than whole text
Developing stratergies together?
Extra challange stratergies?
motivation? confidence? ability? (if they are not confident, does it mean they are not able?)

Zoom out - now what does that mean/imply for planning overall?
Target for the student? this week? Target for the student last week?

Feedback to mentor and student - congratulate them


Starter:
spot the errors in the code?


Mentor weekly record sheet (FIND IT)

## In conversation with the student
* Was that a normal mentor meeting?

* How confident are they that progress is being made?
* The extent to which they feel they have been able to implement pedagogical approaches from SP sessions and what they feel has been their impact on pupils’ progress?
* Number of observation 
   * that they have undertaken of other colleagues both in the department 
   * and across other subjects. (3 others before christmas's?)
   * How many lesson packs to date?
* The use that has been made of the focused lesson observation forms
* Progress with targets against the Subject Knowledge Tracker
