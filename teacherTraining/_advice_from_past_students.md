Below are comments made by students at the end of their PGCE

1. What advice/wisdom would you give to next years PGCE/SD students? This could be (anonymously) conveyed in the first session next year.
2. What could Christ Church (in general) do differently?
3. What could I (as a subject tutor) do differently?

### Advice

Take one week at a time otherwise you'll feel overwhelmed. Try to do the academic reading for 1h at the weekend, 
so regular activity will make it substantial after a few months! The rhythm and amount of work will feel like a slow start 
but will seriously increase by November! You will get better... you're also learning like your students! 
If you feel that you can't cope, talk to your mentor at school or your tutor at uni, they're here to help you!
There's always a solution...


The uni needs to change the order of the assignments, the research assignment was introduced in November but due in April.
The subject assignment was introduced at the same time, in December but due in February.
It felt like adding a huge amount of academic work added at the same time when the school work was increasing in volume as well.


You’re teaching because you love the subject and you want to pass on knowledge so you’re automatically a good teacher. I think it is therefore really important to be yourself and try not to emulate other teachers. 
Linked to this, I found I had to create my own resources to match my teaching style - If I used other teachers’ PowerPoints, worksheets etc the lessons would feel fake as I felt I was working around those rather than teaching in a way that felt comfortable to me. Older students respect that more than younger students, so behaviour management becomes far more important with younger years. 
In the first year I taught my A-Level students got good grades but looking back my teaching was pretty awful – so you can do it even with little or no experience!! 
Students like to work in their own way and until you get to know your students you won’t know that. 
One thing I was slow in learning was the need for marking well and giving effective feedback – i.e. letting pupils know what they need to do to get better marks / improve their work etc. Since I’ve improved on this the more able students have really managed to excel.
I was also quite bad at setting classroom expectations. Once I had the confidence to wait for the class to be quiet I found that generally behaviour improved. Never try to teach over poor behaviour.


Never feel guilty about taking a break.
When it's difficult but you stick at it, the feeling of accomplishment is worth it. 
Don't be shy with your mentor. They are there to help you. 
Ask questions that you have, even if you think they are stupid. 
Take advantage of your placement, take every resource you can get a hold of. 
Try to repay these favours. You are there to make connections. The teaching world is a small one. 
Visit as many different subjects that you can. Watch as many different teachers as you can.  
Being able to be empathic might be your strongest asset as a teacher. 


Opening statement to PGCE Students
* It’s not about your knowledge, it’s about ensuring that students gain the knowledge and love of the subject.
* Learn the techniques for controlling a class – students aren’t adults. Ensure you provide a good/safe environment for students to learn.
* Try and build a good relationship with your mentor and the department you’re working with.
* Even experienced teachers make mistakes so don’t be too hard on yourself.
* Good software development is about re-use – so use existing resources as a base, don’t create them from scratch.
* Don’t leave it to the last minute to collate evidence for your bundles. 




### What could CCCU do differently

### What could subject tutor do differently

Subject Computer Science Teaching Element
* More focus on what good looks like?
    * Lesson planning
    * Lesson & SKE content
    * Lesson objectives
    * Lesson delivery
* More focus on behaviour management?
* More focus on which computer science pedagogy works? 
    * Show examples of these and explain why?
* Impression – seemed to be a lack of science behind what we were being shown in some of the lectures.
* Assignments
    * Again, no clear examples of what distinction, merit or good looks like.
    * Some of the directions were nebulous.
    * Some of the material in the epistemic lectures seemed woolly.
