AI in the classroom
===================

Introduction and ideas

Where is the AI (5min)
---------------

TASK: Think Pair Share
* Using [National curriculum in England: computing programmes of study](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study)
* Where is the AI?

Train
-----

* In pairs
* Create 4 rules/descriptions/ways-of-describing
* a butterfly
* from the pictures below

Categorise
----------

* Using your rules/descriptions/ways-of-describing
* Each rule could be ranked from
    * 1.0 (it is there - I'm very confident it's there)
    * 0.5 (it's sort of there)
    * 0.0 (it is not there - I don't see it)
* Calculate a _Confidence_ score
    * Add them together and divide by the number of rules

### Example

* It has 2 wings
* It's on a green plant
* It has white bits on wings
* Top of it's wings are bigger than the bottom of the wings

Hands on 'Teachable Machine' (10min)
----------------------------

* [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)

TASK: Train your AI with your video camera to identify 3 emotions


---

30min - Hands on with a KS3 AI activity. An unplugged activity for categorising butterfly's and hands on training of an AI with a webcam with Googles Teachable-Machine.
30min - Q&A Brainstorm about school centred computing pedagogy ideas. Between us we can discuss difficult areas of the Computing curriculum to deliver and share good practice. How would you like us a university to support you next year with our skillset.
30min - Tour of facilities with Seb demoing a reverse engineering exercise.





Project based

Co-Teaching (with another teacher - cross pedagogy)

Finland - computing integrated in all subjects (history! RE!)
    Asking the the other teachers: do you want to do programming (rule driven)? .. or do you want to do data-driven?

Growing up with AI

Children program their own smart device
This removed/demystified the "smartness" of machines

Children don't know what _bias_ means, but they do know what _fairness_ means

Workshop

* [Microsoft Plans to Eliminate Face Analysis Tools in Push for ‘Responsible A.I.’](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/21/technology/microsoft-facial-recognition.html)
    * > For years, activists and academics have been raising concerns that facial analysis software that claims to be able to identify a person’s age, gender and emotional state can be biased, unreliable or invasive — and shouldn’t be sold.
