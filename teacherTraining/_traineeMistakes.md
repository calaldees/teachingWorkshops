Things people bugger up with teacher training
----------------------------------------------

Calm down

* Read the handbook
* collate information from multiple sources
    * multiple schools, multiple university modules
    * mechanical dates and locations
        * look at the calendar
    * keep group wiki (between you can collate information)
    * Emails will be sent to mandatory surveys
        * "I didnt get it" - not an excuse

* Accusational tone -> problem solving
    * I have tried
* Email rules - 
* take notes - don't be told things twice
* Don't say "I won't be in the session today" ask for _permission_
* Your classmates are not your friends, they are other professionals you work with
* tackle language + attendance swiftly (this is to help you develop and prevent issues later)
* Get out of the mindset of being "a student at uni". You are a professional now
* Don't talk about your finances
* Don't talk about your career aspirations, etc as a trainee
    * You simply don't know the domain yet
* You don't need to personal friends with colleagues to be able to work with them professionally
    * There are age and cultural differences

* Organise your time
    * You don't have a linear set of assignments to do
* Organise information from a variety of sources
    * Multiple emails accounts (student, school1, school2, personal) - you need email rules/forwarding
    * Takes notes, your mentors don't like telling you multiple times
* Communicate professionally
    * Use email formally
    * Ask for the support you need clearly - problem solve
    * Don't blame others and whinge constantly "you do not give me the link"
    * Don't use Unneeded micro aggression phase's "Beyond belief"
    * legal action is not your first option
    * I will raise a support plan quickly
* The course is not subservient to you - you need your mentors/school to collect the evidence you need to pass
* You are a rank armature - don't be condescending to your school mentors
* There are not absolutes - much is unknown - Nobody _knows_ how to teach
* Attendance
    * Just don't really feel up to it (the growth story - lack of sleep but still went it) - other jobs 'take the day off' sounds reasonable
* Your students are NOT you - stop using yourself as a benchmark
    * How you learned
    * your interests are not their interests "learn by making games; Who doesn't like games"
    * What % of your students will get a degree in Computing?

playing games when in remote sessions
Doing other tasks and only responding when needed

Attendance
----------

* You have a duty of care for 30 young people at 8:45
* It's not a normal office job where you can just take a day off if you're not feeling _up to it_
* "I don't really feel like it today" - find a new profession
    * Image these roles using that phrase
        * Surgeon
        * Lawyer
        * Policemen
        *
