Computer Science Diagram Tooling
================================

* Learning objective
    * Understand that _formal technical computer science diagrams_ can be represented in _plain text_ and rendered as diagrams
* Timing
    * 10 min technology introduction
    * 5 min hands on
    * 5 min summary

## Formal Computer Science diagram notations

* [FlowChart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart)
    * A flowchart can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm
    * Any drawing program can be used to create flowchart diagrams, but these will have no underlying data model
    * Many software packages exist that can create flowcharts ... from a flowchart description language
* [State Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram) is a type of diagram used in computer science and related fields to describe the behaviour of systems
* [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) (Unified Modelling Language)
    * [Class Diagram](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/what-is-class-diagram/)
    * [Sequence Diagram](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/what-is-sequence-diagram/) interaction diagrams that detail how operations are carried out
* [Entity Relationship Diagram](https://www.smartdraw.com/entity-relationship-diagram/) the relationships of entity sets stored in a database
* There are more ...

How many of these have you heard of?

* Computing textbooks are full of these formal notations
* In an exam, students could be asked to:
    * Translate a flowchart into code
    * Complete a state transition diagram
    * Create SQL statements from an ER Diagram
    * Follow a tree with a depth first search algorithm
    * etc
* As computing teachers:
    * We regularly need to create activities with these diagrams
    * We need tools to make creating these diagrams swifter

## General purpose drawing tools

* General freeform vector shapes/text - often connectable with lines (sometimes anchorage to shapes)
* Examples
    * Drawing tools in Microsoft Office (desktop)
    * [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/)
* Problems
    * Time consuming
    * Inconsistent layout
    * Difficult to enforce consistent style

## Advantages of _text representation of formal diagrams_
* Less human time required
* Accessibility
* Consistent styling
* Trivially distributable and modifiable

## Technology example `Mermaid`

* [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/)
    * [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/)

### Tutor Demo 1 - Basic syntax
```mermaid
graph TD
    a --> b --> c --> d
    c --> a
```

### Tutor Demo 2 - Naming items and ladled arrows
```mermaid
graph TD
    start(Ready to eat)
    hungry{Am I hungry?}
    eat(Nom some doughnuts)
    stop(I'm going to get some sleep)
    
    start --> hungry
    hungry -- Yes --> eat --> hungry
    hungry -- No --> stop
```

### Task: Create a mermaid flowchart

* Reproduce the following program as a flowchart using [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/) (7 min)
* Paste your solutions into the chat


```
start program
init sum to 0 and count to 0
ask user for a number `n`
sum=sum+n
count=count+1
if count < 5 then ask for the user for another number
print sum
stop program
```

(copy and paste this to start)
```
graph TD
    start(Start)
    init[sum=0 <br> count=0]
    %% complete this?
    stop(Stop)

    start --> init --> stop
```

## Use

* Trivially export SVG's
* Mermaid (and other tech) can be embedded in Markdown
    * [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) supports mermaid + other renderers
    * [HackMD plugin for vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HackMD.vscode-hackmd)
    * [GitLab supports mermaid](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#diagrams-and-flowcharts)
    * GitHub - does not support mermaid - [Mermaid Support ticket](https://github.community/t/feature-request-support-mermaid-markdown-graph-diagrams-in-md-files/1922/42)

Snakes and ladders flowchart

```mermaid
graph TD
    
    %% AQA GCSE Computer Science : Steve Cushing
    %% Chapter 2: Using Flowcharts - pg21
    %% Figure 2.8 A flowchart for playing snakes and ladders

    %% Start game
    %% Throw the diceL the number indicated by dice is  X
    %% Move your counter: x square on the board
    %% If counter is on snakes head
    %%   slide down snake to its tale
    %% If counter is on bottom of ladder
    %%   climb up ladder
    %% If counter is on last block
    %%   end the game
    %% Give dice to next player
    %% Repeat until someone reaches the last block

    
    start(Start)
    give[Give dice to <br> next player]
    roll[Throw Dice]
    move[Move counter <br> number of places <br> shown on dice]
    land_snake{landed <br> on snake <br> head?}
    land_ladder{landed <br> on the <br> bottom of a <br> ladder?}
    last_square{Reacher <br> the last <br> block of the <br> game?}
    move_down[Slide down <br> to the tail of <br> the snake]
    move_up[Move up <br> the ladder]
    game_over[Output you <br> are the winner]
    finish(End)

    start --> roll --> move --> land_snake
    land_snake -- No --> land_ladder
    land_ladder -- No --> last_square
    last_square -- Yes --> game_over --> finish

    last_square -- No --> give
    land_snake -- Yes --> move_down --> give
    land_ladder -- Yes --> move_up --> give
    give --> roll
```

Solution

```mermaid

    start(Start)
    init[sum=0 <br> count=0]
