Why don’t students like school?
-------------------------------

### My headline summary
* Many of the core tenets of teaching we preach come from this seminal classic
* > Respect Students’ Limited Knowledge and Space in Working Memory
* Problems should be 'not too hard' 'not too easy'
* Encourage and praise process/effort - but still identify/call-out weaker work

* [The genius of DT Willingham and WDSLS](https://teacherhead.com/2021/06/22/the-genius-of-dt-willingham-and-wdsls/) - Tom Sherrington 2021
    * [Why Don’t Students Like School](https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/WILLINGHAM%282%29.pdf) - as featured in American Educator
        * Teachers are _success's_ of the education _system/process_ and enjoy learning
        * > (teachers are) dejected when they find that some of their pupils don’t like school much
        * > ... teachers should reconsider how they encourage their students to think in order to maximize the likelihood that students will get the pleasurable rush that comes from successful thought
        * > our brains are designed not for thought, but for the avoidance of thought
        * > Most of the problems you face are ones you’ve solved before, so you just do what you’ve done in the past
        * > Using memory doesn’t require much of your attention, so you are free to daydream
        * > Working on a problem with no sense that you’re making progress is not pleasurable. In fact, it’s frustrating. And there’s not great pleasure in simply knowing the answer either.
        * > (people) quickly evaluate how much mental work it will take to solve the problem. If it’s too much or too little, people stop working on the problem
        * > successful thinking relies on four factors: 
          >   1. information from the environment,
          >   2. facts in long-term memory,
          >   3. procedures in long-term memory,
          >   4. and space in working memory.
          >
          > If any one of them is inadequate, thinking will likely fail. 
        * > scan each lesson plan with an eye toward the cognitive work that students will be doing. How often does such work occur? Is it intermixed with cognitive breaks? When you have identified the challenges, consider whether they are open to negative outcomes
        * > Respect Students’ Limited Knowledge and Space in Working Memory
        * > what the key question for that lesson might be, and how you can frame that question so that it will be of the right level of difficulty to engage your students
        * > (some students) are behind the others; giving them work that is beyond them is unlikely to help them catch up,
        * > you must first be sure that they believe that they can improve, and next you must try to persuade them that it will be worth it
        * Praise the process they tackled the task with
            * _Poor test results_ == you didn't put in the time
        * > do your slower students really know how to study?
        * > Catching Up Is the Long-Term goal ... to catch up, slower students must work harder than the brighter students.
        * > their _important teacher_ set high standards and believed that they could meet those standards.
        * > be wary of praising second-rate work

Mentor Knowledge
----------------

### My headline summary
* Mentors rely on their practical skills. They do not have the time to deeply engage with theory
* > ‘referring to theory’ appears to range low on most mentors' agenda
* > the less time mentors have, the more they will tend to rely on knowledge acquired in the course of their professional practice and personal experience,
  > resorting to established strategies ‘that work’, rather than attempting new approaches in search of solutions to problematic situations
* > we need to enable mentors to free themselves from the idiosyncratic practices they may have developed over the years by providing access to adequate training and developmental programmes

* [What informs mentors' practice when working with trainees and newly qualified teachers? An investigation into mentors' professional knowledge base](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02607470600655227) 2007 Jones M, Straker K
    * > (the) majority of mentors draw on their teacher knowledge without sufficiently taking into account the specific aspects of adult learners and the generic principles underpinning mentoring.
    * > interpretations of the mentoring role were multiple and diverse, predominantly depending on individuals' personal assumptions of what the role entailed.
    * > we trust mentors to have a substantial input in the professional training ... but how do mentors know what they know?
    * > most mentors have been identified as effective practitioners and good role models, but until they can make their practice and the rationale underpinning that practice accessible, they are unlikely to succeed as mentors
    * > ... all too often, theory remains in the university domain and practice within that of the school.
    * Study of 100 mentors (primary/secondary) 2004
    * > Goal: produce an initial map of the professional knowledge base which currently informs mentors' work

    * > the less time mentors have, the more they will tend to rely on knowledge acquired in the course of their professional practice and personal experience, resorting to established strategies ‘that work’, rather than attempting new approaches in search of solutions to problematic situations
    * > we need to enable mentors to free themselves from the idiosyncratic practices they may have developed over the years by providing access to adequate training and developmental programmes
    * Education Theory/Literiture in school
        * > ‘referring to theory’ appears to range low on most mentors' agenda, regardless of the sector in which they work.
        * > (mentors) employing strategies of ‘replication’ and ‘application’ rather than through the ‘interpretation of theory’
            * When asked to explain the rational underlying their decision they often referred to ‘personal experience’ and ‘intuition’
        * > the absence of references to theory provides evidence that the frequently discussed theory–practice dichotomy remains an issue
        * > (mentors) described as challenging working with ‘weak’ or ‘unwilling’ trainees, dealing with trainees' personal stress and mediating between trainee and colleagues
        * > seems to have led to the general assumption that practice knowledge is superior to theoretical knowledge
    * > mentees' perspectives ... Reference was also made to the more generic mentoring attributes, such as approachability, availability and supportiveness, although to a lesser extent than to the technicalities of teaching.
    * > Shulman's model of teacher knowledge can indeed provide an initial conceptual framework as an analogy to which a model of mentors' professional knowledge can be constructed,
        * Content knowledge—mentors' teacher knowledge
    * > ‘after all, teaching is a creative act rather than a set of prescribed events’, an aspect to which none of the mentors participating in this study referred.
    * > (mentors) conceded that frequently they adopted a ‘trial and error’ approach to managing such situations
    * > Some good teachers can be too rigid in their approach and think that their way is the right way and the only way of doing things. This can cause conflict in the mentor relationship and doesn't promote independent development.
    * > Tomlinson (1995) emphasises the importance of mentors and trainees participating in ‘progressive collaborative teaching’ ... as indicated by the findings of this study, Edwards and Protheroe (2003) argue that they have seen very little evidence of team teaching as mentors provide more traditional supervision shaped by their relationship with the higher education institution and the expectations of the school.
    * > The danger inherent in such a belief lies in the power and status it allocates to individual mentors' experiences and practice, the consequence of which could be an inflexible, idiosyncratic approach to mentoring and thus to professional training and development.
    * > (mentors) did not embrace wider educational issues. It therefore remains open to speculation as to what extent mentors possess and are willing to use the knowledge which assists mentees in their understanding of the impact contextual factors have upon the process of education
    * > mentoring must not be exclusively be perceived as a training device in relation to measurable outcomes, but needs to encompass a host of other dimensions.
    * > study raise doubts as to whether quality mentoring support can be consistently assured as an entitlement for all trainees
    * > mentors distinguish between the trainees' and their own needs as well as the school's goals.
    * > (mentors) tend to replicate strategies they use with their pupils.
    * > The way in which mentors perform their roles as evaluators, assessors and ‘critical friends’ will inevitably influence the quality of the mentoring relationship and largely determine the extent to which a critical, reflective or a conformist, passive attitude towards professional development is promoted
