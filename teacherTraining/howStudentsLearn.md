        * > (teachers are) dejected when they find that some of their pupils don’t like school much
        * > ... teachers should reconsider how they encourage their students to think in order to maximize the likelihood that students will get the pleasurable rush that comes from successful thought
        * > our brains are designed not for thought, but for the avoidance of thought
        * > Most of the problems you face are ones you’ve solved before, so you just do what you’ve done in the past
        * > Using memory doesn’t require much of your attention, so you are free to daydream
        * > Working on a problem with no sense that you’re making progress is not pleasurable. In fact, it’s frustrating. And there’s not great pleasure in simply knowing the answer either.
        * > (people) quickly evaluate how much mental work it will take to solve the problem. If it’s too much or too little, people stop working on the problem
        * > successful thinking relies on four factors:

[Understanding How we Learn - A visual guide](https://www.learningscientists.org/book) 2018
[visuals by oliver calgary](https://www.olicav.com/#/understanding-how-we-learn/)
Read this book preview.
When reading; make notes about action points that would affect the planning of your computing lessons.
We will revisit the topic of 'planning lessons' armed with this information.
Many of the topics touched on in the reading will be explored in more detail in the session.

TASK: From our reading - Discuss
1. How do we Learn?
2. How will this affect planning our computing lessons?

### My Notes

* Chapter 1 - Communication Breakdown Between Science and Practice in Education
    * Research == good - our intuition is often wrong
    * Old thinking should be challenged
* Chapter 2 - Different Types of Evidence in Education
    * Behavioural psychology, cognitive psychology and neuroscience are experimental disciplines
    * Blogs, books + other - should be consumed critically
* Chapter 3 - Is Intuition the Enemy of Teaching and Learning?
    * Reading easy - so must be working
    * Retrieval feels harder - so must not as effective
* Chapter 4 - Pervasive Misunderstandings about Learning: How They Arise, and What Can We Do?
    * Many myths - learning styles
    * Shaming people is not a effective way to change minds
* Chapter 5 - Perception
    * Curse of knowledge
* Chapter 6 - Attention
    * Attention is a limited resource
    * Avoid overload
    * Selective focus - switching tasks slow
    * Mind wondering can miss vital information
* Chapter 7 - Memory
    * Not like computer - use == reconstructing == strengthen
    * Not objective - imagination can become memories
    * Short term memory == 30 seconds
    * Once encoded - we rapidly start to forget
* Chapter 8 - Strategies
    * Spacing (interleaving)
    * Elaboration
    * Concrete (real) examples
    * Visuals (dual coding)
    * Retrieval
* Chapter 9 Planning learning
    * Spacing is hard to stick to schedule
* Chapter 10 Developing understanding
    * Elaborate (add features to memory) - 'How' 'Why'
    * Must be connected to pre-existing knowledge
    * Multiple concrete (real) examples
    * Duel coding - images + words
* Chapter 11 Reinforcing learning
    * Act of retrieval strengthens memory
    * Frequent low stakes quizzes
    * Any retrieval practice is good (it feels hard)
    * Avoid 'feel good' learning


* [retrieval starters](https://twitter.com/MissHudsonHist/status/1370781735319957507) [googleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jfO1pgCXXGCmUlZ28XW08Z0lENwNhAph/view) i saved the pptx

### How will this affect planning our computing lessons?

* Test/Quiz == Retrieval/Recall == better learning
* Test/Quiz regularly
* Test/Quiz past topics
* Test, Test, Test, Assess, Assess, Assess, Quiz, Quiz, Quiz - use that to plan


Theory to Practice
------------------

All of this theory is useful. To make it have real world application in your teaching, you should always be thinking:

"With this theory ... When I am planning a lesson I will ..."

After each theory chunk, I will ask the question. 
What does this mean for your computing planning?
We will use breakout rooms of 2/3 for you to quickly discuss what actions you will take when planning a lesson.


Have the [Computing National Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study#key-stage-3) to hand


Old Theories 
------------

* Understanding How We Learn - Chapter 1 - Communication Breakdown Between Science and Practice in Education
    * From pre reading - 
    * > Teacher-training textbooks and courses sometimes propagate misunderstandings about learning 
    *  Dr Yana Weinstein and Dr Megan Sumeracki 2018
    * [Dual Coding and Learning Styles](https://www.learningscientists.org/blog/2019/6/6-1) - learning styles not effective
        * > Dual coding and learning styles sound similar, but are not quite the same thing. 
            > While dual coding has scientific evidence backing its use, 
            > learning styles has been repeatedly tested and shown not to improve learning.
* Video [Howard Gardner on Multiple Intelligences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgO8jZTFuQ) Gardener 1997
    * In 20 years - education has moved on. The idea that _individuals learn in different ways_ has largely been debunked. Much more is now known about the way we encode, chunk and schema knowledge.

Cognitive load theory
---------------------

[Cognitive Load Theory and its application in the classroom](https://impact.chartered.college/article/shibli-cognitive-load-theory-classroom/) Chartered College of Teaching Journal 2020

> Dylan Wiliam tweeted on 26 January 2017 that he had ‘come to the conclusion Sweller’s Cognitive Load Theory is the single most important thing for teachers to know

Attention is a finite resource and can be depleted quickly.

> Working memory should be seen as short term and finite, 
> whereas long-term memory can be seen as infinite. 
>
> The aim should be to move knowledge to long-term memory 
> because when a student is exposed to new material, 
> they can draw on this previous knowledge and the cognitive load is reduced.
>
> However, if subject knowledge is incomplete, 
> the student is unable to fall back on the long-term memory and the working memory becomes overloaded, 
> leading to working memory failures. 
(Gathercole and Alloway, 2007),

> Be wary of reducing cognitive load too much – the learning process should be manageable, but not overly fragmented.

[Cognitive Load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load) John Sweller 198x?

> Gesturing is a technique children use to reduce cognitive load while speaking

Liminal Space
-------------

* [Learning in the Liminal Space: a Semiotic Approach to Threshold Concepts](http://dro.dur.ac.uk/13381/1/13381.pdf) 2014 Ray Land et al
    * [Threshold Concepts in Practice](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Threshold-Concepts-Practice-Educational-Futures/dp/9463005102/) 2016
    * > These conceptual gateways are integrative, exposing the previously hidden interrelatedness of ideas, and are irreversible.
      > However they frequently present troublesome knowledge and are often points at which students become stuck. 
      > Difficulty in understanding may leave the learner in a 'liminal' state of transition, a 'betwixt and between' space of knowing and not knowing, where understanding can approximate to a form of mimicry.
      > Learners navigating such spaces report a sense of uncertainty, ambiguity, paradox, anxiety, even chaos
* Forgetting is normal - Liminal space is normal - reassure them it is normal
* Don't rush to students to 'make it right' let them grapple with the problem

* Example
    * Threshold concepts
        * If statements
        * For loops
        * Variables
    * Once we understand those threshold concepts, we can move on to Algorithms

    * > A knowledge organiser (KO) sets out the important, useful and powerful knowledge on a topic on a single page (Kirby, 2015). With the content demands of new courses, and schools adopting a knowledge-based curriculum, these are becoming increasingly popular in schools
* [Improved Results & Workload with Knowledge Organisers](https://blog.teamsatchel.com/case-study-improving-results-and-reducing-workloads-with-knowledge-organisers-and-quizzes)
    * > “My students just keep forgetting everything - even though I’ve taught it to them over and over again!”
    * > Knowledge Organisers are an increasingly popular teaching method in schools and simply involve distilling the key information for a term’s teaching, or a topic, onto 1 side of A4 – similar to a graphic organiser.
      > This Knowledge Organiser is given to students as homework on Show My Homework with instructions for students and parents on how the students can test themselves, and how the parents can test their children, to memorise as much of the key information as possible.
* [Are knowledge organisers flawed?](https://learningspy.co.uk/psychology/are-knowledge-organisers-flawed/)
    * > most schools don’t have self-quizzing cultures built in. Students don’t use them effectively and just copy words across blindly without self-quizzing.
      > Worse than that, the KO’s are just stuck into students’ books (or reside at the bottom of their bags) and are never looked at again. 
      > This is a waste of time, but it certainly doesn’t mean that KOs are a bad idea. All it means is that – like everything else – inventions work best when resources, practice and purpose are aligned.

* [To the brain, reading computer code is not the same as reading language](https://news.mit.edu/2020/brain-reading-computer-code-1215) 2020 - Neuroscientists find that interpreting code activates a general-purpose brain network, but not language-processing centers.
    * > The findings suggest there isn’t a definitive answer to whether coding should be taught as a math-based skill or a language-based skill. In part, that’s because learning to program may draw on both language and multiple demand systems, even if — once learned — programming doesn’t rely on the language regions, the researchers say.


Closing Thoughts
----------------

* Knowledge is always built on previous knowledge
    * As a teacher - if you are aware of the actual previous knowledge (and not just because _you've covered_ it) you can create meaningful sequence
* As a learner - If you're not aware of your knowledge gaps, you assume you don't have them
    * Recall and Evaluation are key
* Train students to check their own knowledge and train them to check each others knowledge
* Idea: Ask students to 'Describe a concept with a picture/diagram/visual'. great retrieval practice

Feedback:
* You are now on your way to become professional educations.
* Given the material I have just introduced you to, how could this online 3 hours could have been constructed to cement these concepts in more detail? More active learning? how? was it appropriate to introduce you to these topics and allow you to explore them?

    * [Harry FletcherWood](https://twitter.com/HFletcherWood/status/1326212067917959168)
        * I have been very sceptical about growth mindset over the last few years, but a new study has substantially changed my mind
        * In research-design terms, this was bulletproof: pre-registered, randomly-assigned, teachers didn't know which students got the growth mindset intervention and analysis team didn't know the hypothesis or which group was which.
        * Students did 2 x 25-minute online activities about growth mindset: just telling them that we can get smarter (not telling them to practice).  These were conveyed using various powerful techniques (like stories from role models).
        * The impact: a) it changed students’ opinions about whether they could learn, b) lower-attaining students gained higher grades, c) students were more likely to choose more challenging maths courses the following year.
        * The intervention had less effect if the school was already effective (most students did well there), and if peer norms about achievement were negative.
        * I can't fault the study. Worth noting that this was designed by a stellar team - but it's scalable and powerful: 0.1 SD increase in GPA for an hour's intervention. So I'm having to update: growth mindset is more promising than I'd thought
* Growth Mindset does not work

Dweck is a coauthor on all three studies that show that teaching a growth mindset can improve students’ school performance.

Zone of Proximal Development
* Scaffolding originated Vygotsky 1981
* incremental social contact - what they can do unaided and what they can do with contact with others
* What the learner can do, what the learner can do with support, what the learnner cannot do.
* Didau - "Goldylocks Zone" - not too hard, not too easy
* [What Is the zone of proximal development?. Simply psychology.](https://www.simplypsychology.org/Zone-of-Proximal-Development.html) McLeod, S. A. (2019)
    * > problem-solving under adult guidance, or in collaboration with more capable peers <sub>Vygotsky, 1978</sub>
    * The distance between what the learner is able to do unaided, compared to with expert or advanced peer support
    * According to Vygotsky (1978), much important learning by the child occurs through social interaction with a skillful tutor. The tutor may model behaviors and/or provide verbal instructions for the child. Vygotsky refers to this as cooperative or collaborative dialogue. 
    * Scaffolding consists of the activities provided by the educator, or more competent peer, to support the student as he or she is led through the zone of proximal development.
    * Support is tapered off (i.e. withdrawn) as it becomes unnecessary, much as a scaffold is removed from a building during construction. The student will then be able to complete the task again on his own.
    * Scaffolding vs. Discovery Learning
        * Freund (1990) wanted to investigate if children learn more effectively via Piaget's concept of discovery learning or by guided learning via the ZPD. 
    > From a Vygotskian perspective, the teacher's role is mediating the child's learning activity as they share knowledge through social interaction' (Dixon-Krauss, 1996)
    * Consider these guidelines for scaffolding instruction (Silver, 2011)
        * Assess the learner's current knowledge and experience for the academic content
        * Relate content to what students already understand or can do
        * Break a task into small, more manageable tasks with opportunities for intermittent feedback
        * Use verbal cues and prompts to assist students


Howland, J. L., Jonassen, D. H. and Marra, R. M., Meaningful Learning with Technology (Pearson, 2011)
* Active
    * Pupils should be actively engaged in their learning – typically this will be doing something on a computer, but it could also be taking part in a discussion or an activity away from the computer, such as role-play to illustrate how packets of data travel across the internet.
* Constructive
    * This can be understood both in the sense of constructing meaning, developing pupils’ mental model of computation and technologies, and in the sense of making something, whether this is a computer program, a presentation or a blog post.
* Intentional
    * Ideally, pupils should have some degree of choice over how they tackle a task or project, or perhaps even over the task or project itself. It is unlikely they will learn much from copying a worked solution off an IWB screen, and many projects can be constructed or adapted to allow plenty of scope for individual creativity.
* Authentic
    * Wherever possible, try to link activities with pupils’ own experiences, both within and beyond school: cross-curricular projects work very well, as do those linked to the life of the school itself, or to pupils’ experiences of technology.
* Cooperative
    * Computing, in both industrial and academic contexts, is a collaborative endeavour. Where possible, construct activities so that pupils can work together, supporting one another in their learning


* [Education Research: The evidence](https://gregashman.wordpress.com/2020/11/13/education-research-the-evidence/) Greg Ashman 2020
    * You do not learn something better if you figure it out for yourself
    * Learning styles are a myth
    * If you give students choice over how they learn, the often choose the least effective method
    * Testing is a highly effective way to boost learning
    * The evidence for the effectiveness of whole-class, interactive explicit teaching comes from a wide range of studies
    * Broad world knowledge is essential to reading comprehension
    * You cannot just Google facts when you need them
    * Achievement boosts motivation
