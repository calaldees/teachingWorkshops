    * > (Citizenship) equips pupils with the cultural capital they need to succeed in modern Britain
    * > The Association for Citizenship Teaching (ACT) recently tweeted news of the outcome of an Ofsted pilot visit with the new EIF where a school in Dorset was put into special measures because the deep dive showed that it failed to offer a sufficiently rich and balanced curriculum that included subjects and aspects such as Citizenship, FBV and could not fully promote pupils’ SMSC development. This underlines the dangers lurking for those schools that have downgraded their provision for Citizenship in the curriculum and their promotion of FBV and SMSC under the current inspection framework.
    * > there are very encouraging signs that schools will have considerable opportunities to make their Citizenship provision and its contribution to FBV and SMSC an explicit part of the curriculum and the conversations they have with inspectors

    * Digital Equity 
        * is the social justice goal of ensuring that everyone in our society has equal access to technology tools, computers and the Internet. It is when all individuals have the knowledge and skills to access and use technology tools, computers and the Internet.
    * Digital wisdom 
        * is the ability of individuals and/or societies to make informed decisions in relation to the appropriate use and exploitation of information technology in all its forms

Youth Language (30min group)
--------------

* Try to be aware of the language the youth in your school are using. It could be important for you spotting abuse or intimidation.
    * Most of the time the students LOVE talking about this to teachers. They love the reversal of knowing something more than the teacher. These are good lunchtime conversations.
