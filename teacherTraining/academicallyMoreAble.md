    * _A lecture_ is the transfer of knowledge from the notepad of the lecturer to the notepad of the learner without engaging the brain
    * Get to know them - tap into their interests
    * How hard did they think - ask them 'scale of 1 to 10'
    * teddy 16cm,19cm,12cm how many would fit in classroom? How many golf balls in brazil?
    * How are you making them think?

        * A label gives pressure to student?
    * Is it good to be clever? (social stigma)
    * Get them to Link things (mind map, )
    * Verbal and your dialogue - is powerful and immediate - written is not timely and seldom interpreted correctly

### Expertise Reversal Effect

* Too much support for weaker learners can harm the most able
    * [Expertise Reversal Effect and its Instructional Implications](https://impact.chartered.college/article/expertise-reversal-effect-instructional-implications/)
        * > ... a technique that reduces working memory load for low-knowledge learners (e.g. by providing strong instructional support) might lose its effectiveness and may even bring negative consequences for more knowledgeable learners; they may learn better in an environment with minimal guidance. This is known as the expertise reversal effect ...
        * > ... implication of the effect is the need to develop an adaptive learning environment in which learning materials are tailored in accordance with learners’ current levels of achievement ...
