ETAS
====

The assessment for this module will take the form of a teaching portfolio.
The portfolio will be made up of 4 sections on the following topics:


1. The use of learning technology
2. Assessment and feedback practice
3. Other 
    * (participant’s choice of focus e.g. students as partners in learning, reflective practice in the classroom, use of Academic Peer Mentors etc.)
(All three sections will add up to a total of 2000 words or each of the three parts equivalent in total e.g. 4 minutes of an alternative such as video or voiced PowerPoint - X 3 would be a total of 12-13 minutes)

4. A reflection on an authentic practice observation and feedback activity
(2000 words or equivalent - e.g. 12-13 minutes voiced PowerPoint recording, video with annotations)

Two things to keep at the front of your mind are REFLECT CONSTANTLY and EVALUATE YOUR OWN PRACTICE - so everything you do is about recognising, developing and enhancing your practice and linking it to the activities and research that you do for this module. This does need to be linked to research in the field so try to draw links between what yo read and what you do. 

UKPSF Descriptors that should be covered on this module's summative assessment:
D2.I: A1 and A3 must be achieved. Other As can be achieved between ETAS and SSPI
D2.II: K1, K4 and K6 must be achieved. Others Ks can be achieved between ETAS and SSPI
D2.III: V2 and V4 must be achieved. Other Vs can be achieved between ETAS and SSPI
D2.IV: must be partially achieved in relation to the use of learning technologies and QAE processes
D2.V: must be partially achieved in relation to specific scholarship discussed in the module
D2.VI: does not need to be achieved yet

The use of learning technology (700 words)
------------------------------

(K4 The use and value of appropriate learning technologies)

Using industry standard software tooling to teach introductory programming has benefits and drawbacks.

One of the barriers for students to engage with computer programming is setup of a software development environment. Professional software development environments are complex to setup and often have many 'moving parts' (Choy & Kwan 2005). When starting a new software project, most modern tools ask a range of questions about the project setup. If a novice programmer who's objective is to  experiment with a 3 or 4 line program, they have to navigate multiple dialogues with terminology that the learner is not yet familiar with. This is daunting and unsettling for learners.

This setup issue is also problematic for lecturers. Demoing simple concepts quickly is contaminated by slow arduous setup steps. These are especially noticeable when demonstrating these concepts live to class's.

To tackle this problem, Cloud/web-browser based development environments are becoming more common in education settings. 
50% of development environments used in HE education are now accessible online through a web-browser (Sim & Lau 2018).
Learners can be given a URL and they can begin coding with reduced setup time.

At Canterbury Christ Church University we teach using "Microsoft Visual Studio". While teaching "Application Development with C#" I found I repeatedly wanted to demo techniques without disrupting the students actively loaded project. I also wanted to give students a constrained sandbox to focus/develop one technique. 

 I was able to create a url with a working C# programming environment and an example of a bubble-sort algorithm written in another language (in this case Java). 

Using a service called "repl.it", I constructed a coding exercise (A1 Design and Plan). I listed a complete 'Java' program to implement a bubble-sort algorithm. I also created a stub starter scaffold for a bubble-sort in the the target language for the learner of 'C#' (K1 Subject Knowledge). The task was to implement bubble-sort in C#. As I identified students that needed extra support, I was able to direct them to my additional support activity. With one url students had a code environment presented to them with supporting text.

Student feedback was excellent. Once students completed the support task they were able to integrate the solutions into their project. Out of a class size of 68 students, I refereed 20 of them to my support activity. Some remarked "why didn't we start with this". This was fed back to the module lead. 

Next year we intend to use an extended period of training material. Rather than relying on an external service like "repl.it", we should be able to house something similar internally using "jupyter.org". Jupyter notebooks would allow code examples to be displayed interactively as a development environment embedded in a webpage. Jupyter notebooks have successfully been used in some select education settings (Johson 2020). I am working with the wider School of Computing to develop our use of Jupyter notebooks. (A1 design and plan, K1 Subject knowledge)

The pandemic this year has amplified the disadvantage of some students. During my delivery of Application Development in C# (MCOMD1ADC)
Students that had 'Apple mac' or lower spec computers were unable to participate at home as they required a Windows 10 PC to use Microsoft Visual Studio. These students has had limited access to campus and struggled to participate remotely. (V2 promote participation, V4 Wider context, K6 quality enhancement)

I have begun to experiment with 'Cloud' based development environments. The development environment would run remotely on the cloud and allowing students with low spec machines to access the tooling. IORIO 2020, describes how the Politecnico di Torino in Italy have provided cloud based development environments to their entire Computing cohort. I am in the process of designing an upcoming module "Frameworks and Languages" that is constructed with a 'Cloud first' mentality to give a consistent experience to all students. (A1 design and plan, K1 Subject knowledge). I am investigating "codetasty.com" and "gitpod.io". (Hartmann 2017, Antonova 2020) consider cloud based development environments the way forward for education as it removes technical, administrative and economic barriers. It is also time-saving, flexible and facilitates new modes of realtime collaboration between students.

Cloud based development environments look to be the next big disruptive technology in Computer Science education.

Assessment and feedback practice (700 words)
--------------------------------

In the PGCE in Secondary Computing course that I deliver, I provide a framework for trainee teachers to perform a gap analysis of their subject knowledge and track their subject knowledge development throughout the course. As a postgraduate qualification, a trainee teachers subject knowledge is not formally assessed as part of the course. Students are required to self assess their skills and identify their subject knowledge gaps (Rhoades 2014). Rhoades states "any overestimation or even underestimation of your knowledge will be counter productive". Trainee's self assessment of subject knowledge is varied and inaccurate as they have no benchmark or reference point to based their skills assessment upon (Schmid 2021 1.1). Trainees lack the knowledge of the curriculum to judge if their stills are sufficient. Jones (2021) cited McNamara (1991) in stating; a teachers' restricted subject knowledge affects the quality of teaching and causes serious deficiencies in student learning, this deficiency is not immediately identifiable

Currently trainees are asked to rate their knowledge category's on a scale of 1 (insecure knowledge) to 4 (I could teach this) each school term.
Some examples of the current categories:
* Understand why computer hardware needs computer software (programs)
* Know what computer programming syntax is
* Explain what a computer is
How could a trainee identify that they have moved between a 2 to 3 this term in the categories above? Without the context of the level of curriculum that is being taught (Keystage 2, 3, 4 or 5) and the curriculum content knowledge, the answer trainees might give could vary significantly.

> Existing questionnaires have been criticized regarding the fuzzy, technology-unspecific, and content-agnostic wording of questionnaire items, which ask participants to rate the “appropriateness” of their competencies
Schmid et al 2021

When assessing my trainees I have asked "can you justify/evidence the growth in your subject knowledge". It has been difficult for them to provide evidence of their growth. (A3 assessment give feedback)

I propose two changes to enhance the effectiveness of the skills audit. We could tighten the scope of the categories and clarify the level criteria. This would allow for more accurate self assessment and in turn enhance their effectiveness as teachers.

My re-worked subject knowledge audit proposes a new level system:
1. Theoretical understanding (evidence - maybe past exam question or previous degree module grade)
2. Have implemented on computer (evidence - link to github? screenshot?)
3. Have taught (evidence resources created or lesson plans)
It is clear to the trainee which level they are operating at as they will be able to cite evidence.
The categories will all be taken from the Keystage 5 curriculum. The earlier keystage's are a subset of this knowledge.
The categories will be correlated with industry practice. e.g.
* Algorithms: Sorting: bubble, quick, merge, selection, insertion (2 of)
* Use of remote pair-programming live coding tool
* Use of unit-tests
This new system is much clearer and precise. The ambiguity has been removed and the categories relate directly to practical skills required in the classroom. This impact of this alteration will be assessed in more details as part of the SSPI module next term.

Ultimately assessing subject knowledge for trainee teachers is a secondary concern. What matters is that they can deliver good lessons (V4 wider context). Subject knowledge could ultimately be assessed through the lesson content that the trainees create and deliver. This approach is confirmed by Blömeke & Delaney, 2014 who state that we should be moving beyond self-reported subject knowledge audits.




Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge

Drummond and Sweeney (2017) and Maderick, Zhang, Hartley, and Marchand (2016) showed that self-reported TPACK of pre-service teachers revealed only a weak correlation with a more objective, fact-based knowledge test on TPACK.

research on teacher professional knowledge has moved beyond self-reports and focused on actual classroom performance (Blömeke & Delaney, 2014; Hill, Loewenberg-Ball, & Schilling, 2008).

Other - Enhancing PGCE Recruitment Practice (700 words)
--------------------------------------

I am part of Initial Teacher Training and Education (ITTE) and deliver the PGCE in Secondary Computing for Canterbury Christ Church University. I'm going to discuss students retention in the context of teacher training. I will describe the withdrawals from the course this year as a case study and attempt to analyse possible actions to improve retention in future years.

As educators we are under pressure to recruit for our courses. Without enrolment our courses and organisation are not financially viable. We are also accountable for our retention rates. If our retention rates are not in-line with the national average, the OfS may suspend our ability to deliver our courses. (OfS 2018) (D2 V)

In a drive to recruit more teachers the DfE stated:
> The process to become a teacher is too complicated and burdensome. We will radically simplify the process for becoming a teacher
DfE [Teacher Recruitment and Retention Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-recruitment-and-retention-strategy) 2019
As an institution we are no longer able to mandate experience in schools as a requirement. Could we be removing needed barriers for candidates to consider the gravity of the profession?

My statistics for my cohort of trainee computing teachers. 9 students. 6 PGCE, 3 School Direct (see Hodgson J 2013). Only 4 students completed (44%). This is unacceptable. Recruitment of candidates plays a role in these figures. Other factors such as availably of student support would need also need to be investigated.

At CCCU we support a diverse range of learners (V1 Individual Learners). (Osher 2020) describes how university leavers are 'left in the dark' and are not provided appropriate guidance with transitioning to the world of professional work. One of my young candidates that withdrew stated in an exit interview "I don't know where I fit-in in the world". The student cited that as there were only a few years in age difference between them and the secondary school students, they felt like they were misplaced as a member of teaching staff. (V4 Wider Context). 

Multiple of the PGCE students that withdrew were young and had the relevant entry qualifications. According to (Vare, et al 2003). The biggest predictors of success in Initial Teacher Education was candidates SAT's scores from secondary school. IQ and academic achievement are important factors but this cannot be taken in isolation. I think this is only part of the story. If candidates do not posses the correct rational for training to teach, it is unlikely they will be successful. Young (1995) comments that aspiring trainees could have a 'distorted view' of what teaching entailed, leaving the profession as they began to understand the reality's of the role.

My new strategy when conducting my PGCE interviews is I describe the historical situation that younger students have found themselves in and ask the interview candidate to describe why they might succeed where others have not. We should recognise potential, but we should not knowingly entice candidates that we suspect might be not understand the realities of the profession. I have vetted this question with the 'secondary teacher training lead' as part of ongoing QA of our process (K6 QA).

Mullinix 2002, highlights the importance of 'retaining teacher mentors'. If are mentors are active participants in the recruitment process xxx. As part of my role I have contacted computing teacher mentors across our partnership schools. We have rearranged our interview times so that school mentors can participate in our PGCE trainee recruitment. When discussing the candidates after interview I ask them; "Would you be happy mentoring this applicant in your school? Why? Or why not?". I also confer with mentors about the nature of the candidates motivation and their suitability for the profession.

By including mentors in the process of recruitment I hope to build a stronger bond with the training process in schools. By understanding both the individual students and the mentors backgrounds and strengths, I should be able to collaborate with mentors when allocating school placements. By enhancing the personalised allocation of placements and giving the mentor some ownership of the placment student xxx learning will be more personalised . I expect to see retention rates improve.

### (TODO? remove?) Professional Communication Skills

Multiple students of mine had placements terminated early because of the students inability to communication professionally (UK Teacher Standards: Part2). They were not used to email being a formal mode of communication. In my course next year I will take time to explicitly discuss expected professional behaviours to pre-empt similar issues from occurring again. This year I had identified these problems early and attempted to resolve them by one-to-one discussion. This intervention seemed ineffective. The department has a new 'Targeted Support Plan' process in place. Next year I will highlight to the student the importance of professional communication and use the process to track measurable targets. This formal identification and paperwork should highlight the need to develop these crucial 'softer' skills for the profession. In turn, pre-empting these problems should lead to greater retention.

From a cohort of 9 candidates, 4 completed, 5 withdrew/interrupted/extended. That's over 50% loss.

### Equity of School Experience

(Paul Hamlyn Foundation 2017) states "feeling a part of your course of study and the institution" is one of the biggest drivers of retention.

(Velle 2020) highlights the challenges with teacher training during a pandemic. "both schools and universities, raised significant issues of both equity and pedagogy". Some schools felt burdened by student teachers. One candidate of mine had a placement terminated quite quickly. They were alienated and alone until a second placement was organised. The second school welcomed the students Computing expertise. The student felt valued and needed. "That was exactly want I wanted, to feel needed". It transformed that students engagement with the course.

In conventional courses, the delivery of all aspects of a course are controlled by the delivery team. The PGCE differers because the majority of time is actively training in schools. We are not in control of entire experience of the students. Each school experience is unique. How can we give our students an equitable experience with so many elements being outside of our direct sphere of influence? In my role of QAing school mentors, I will ask them to emphasise a sense of belonging for their placement students as a priority.
