ETAS
====

The assessment for this module will take the form of a teaching portfolio.
The portfolio will be made up of 4 sections on the following topics:


1. The use of learning technology
2. Assessment and feedback practice
3. Other 
    * (participant’s choice of focus e.g. students as partners in learning, reflective practice in the classroom, use of Academic Peer Mentors etc.)
(All three sections will add up to a total of 2000 words or each of the three parts equivalent in total e.g. 4 minutes of an alternative such as video or voiced PowerPoint - X 3 would be a total of 12-13 minutes)

4. A reflection on an authentic practice observation and feedback activity
(2000 words or equivalent - e.g. 12-13 minutes voiced PowerPoint recording, video with annotations)

Two things to keep at the front of your mind are REFLECT CONSTANTLY and EVALUATE YOUR OWN PRACTICE - so everything you do is about recognising, developing and enhancing your practice and linking it to the activities and research that you do for this module. This does need to be linked to research in the field so try to draw links between what yo read and what you do. 

UKPSF Descriptors that should be covered on this module's summative assessment:
D2.I: A1 and A3 must be achieved. Other As can be achieved between ETAS and SSPI
D2.II: K1, K4 and K6 must be achieved. Others Ks can be achieved between ETAS and SSPI
D2.III: V2 and V4 must be achieved. Other Vs can be achieved between ETAS and SSPI
D2.IV: must be partially achieved in relation to the use of learning technologies and QAE processes
D2.V: must be partially achieved in relation to specific scholarship discussed in the module
D2.VI: does not need to be achieved yet


Use the table below to check that you have met the necessary D2 descriptors in your summative assessment and tick them off as you achieve them:

The use of learning technology (700 words)
------------------------------

One of the barriers for students to engage with computer programming is setup of a software development environment. Developments environments are complex to setup and often have many 'moving parts'. Because most software projects are complex, most modern tools ask a range of questions about the project setup. If a novice programmer wants to experiment with a 3 or 4 line program, they have to navigate multiple dialogues with terminology the learner is not yet familiar with. This is daunting and unsettling for learners. It also creates a barrier in class when as a teacher I need to demo a concept quickly.

To tackle this problem, Cloud/web-browser based development environments are becoming more common in education settings. These are systems where learners can be given a URL and they can begin coding with zero setup time.

repl.it

To trial this technology I constructed a coding exercise (A1 Design and Plan). I listed a complete 'Java' program to implement a bubble-sort algorithm. I also created a stub starter scaffold for a bubble-sort in the the target language for the learner of 'C#' (K1 Subject Knowledge). The task was to implement bubble-sort in C#. When I identified students struggling with this concept, I could send them a link to my repl activity. With one click of the link they had a code environment presented to them with support text.

The technology barrier to engaging with a coding task had been dramatically reduced.

I am part of Initial Teacher Training and Education (ITTE) and deliver the PGCE in Secondary Computing for Canterbury Christ Church University. I'm going to discuss students retention in the context of teacher training. I will describe the withdrawals from the course this year as a case study and attempt to analyse possible actions to improve retention in future years.

* > Every student that drops out of their higher education course is a loss: a loss to their university or college, a loss to the future economy and, above all, a loss to that individual. <sub>Professor Patricia Broadfoot 2017</sub>

From a cohort of 9 candidates, 4 completed, 5 withdrew/interrupted/extended. That's over 50% loss.

### Equity of School Experience

(Paul Hamlyn Foundation 2017) states "feeling a part of your course of study and the institution" is one of the biggest drivers of retention.

(Velle 2020) highlights the challenges with teacher training during a pandemic. "both schools and universities, raised significant issues of both equity and pedagogy". Some schools felt burdened by student teachers. One candidate of mine had a placement terminated quite quickly. They were alienated and alone until a second placement was organised. The second school welcomed the students Computing expertise. The student felt valued and needed. "That was exactly want I wanted, to feel needed". It transformed that students engagement with the course.

In conventional courses, the delivery of all aspects of a course are controlled by the delivery team. The PGCE differers because the majority of time is actively training in schools. We are not in control of entire experience of the students. Each school experience is unique. How can we give our students an equitable experience with so many elements being outside of our direct sphere of influence? In my role of QAing school mentors, I will ask them to emphasise a sense of belonging for their placement students as a priority.

### Recruitment

As educators we are under pressure to recruit for our courses. Without enrolment our courses and organisation are not financially viable. We are also accountable for our retention rates. If our retention rates are not in-line with the national average, the OfS may suspend our ability to deliver our courses.

I am involved in interviewing candidates for the Secondary Computing PGCE course. I am supported in these interviews by subject mentors that are active teachers from our partnership of local schools. There is ongoing QA of our interview process from other teacher trainers. 

We support a diverse range of learners (V1 Individual Learners). (Osher 2020) describes how university leavers are 'left in the dark' and are not provided appropriate guidance with transitioning to the world of professional work. One of my young candidates that withdrew stated in an exit interview "I don't know where I fit-in in the world". The student cited that as there were only a few years in age difference between them and the secondary school students, they felt like they were misplaced as a member of teaching staff. (V4 Wider Context). 

> The process to become a teacher is too complicated and burdensome. We will radically simplify the process for becoming a teacher
DfE [Teacher Recruitment and Retention Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-recruitment-and-retention-strategy) 2019

As an institution we are no longer able to mandate experience in schools as a requirement. Could we be removing needed barriers for candidates to consider the gravity of the profession?
My new strategy when conducting my PGCE interviews is I describe the historical situation that younger students have found themselves in and ask the interview candidate to describe why they might succeed where others have not. We should recognise potential, but we should not knowingly entice candidates that we suspect might be not understand the realities of the profession. I will be more discerning in future and specifically prompt for my co-interviewers opinion about the candidates rational for enrolling on the course. (K6 QA)

According to (Vare, et al 2003). The biggest predictors of success in Initial Teacher Education was candidates SAT's scores from secondary school. IQ and academic achievement are important factors but this cannot be taken in isolation.




### (TODO? remove?) Professional Communication Skills

Multiple students of mine had placements terminated early because of the students inability to communication professionally (UK Teacher Standards: Part2). They were not used to email being a formal mode of communication. In my course next year I will take time to explicitly discuss expected professional behaviours to pre-empt similar issues from occurring again. This year I had identified these problems early and attempted to resolve them by one-to-one discussion. This intervention seemed ineffective. The department has a new 'Targeted Support Plan' process in place. Next year I will highlight to the student the importance of professional communication and use the process to track measurable targets. This formal identification and paperwork should highlight the need to develop these crucial 'softer' skills for the profession. In turn, pre-empting these problems should lead to greater retention.

    1. First-generation retention and success focused on ‘fixing up’ the needs of specific groups of students through additional support services to improve retention (pre-What Works?).
    2. Second-generation retention and success focused on student engagement and belonging in their academic learning context to improve success (What Works?1).
    3. Third-generation retention and success focuses on the whole institution working together and using evidence to understand the issues and implement contextually relevant changes across the whole student lifecycle and the entire institution.
