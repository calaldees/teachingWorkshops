Peer Tutorial Guidance
======================

The aim of peer review is to recognise and celebrate your achievements to date, drawing from your SPR1 and to share and discuss your practice so that you can reflect on, and further improve, your professional development.

This is a professional dialogue and therefore the tone and nature of your discussions is important.

Whilst sharing your portfolio you need to take collective responsibility for ensuring that your discussions are focused and constructive.

You will need to share aspects of the following:
* Your portfolio (see The Portfolio Checklist)
* Any other documents needed for agenda items below not in your portfolio


Peer group agenda (timings are approx.):
-----------------

1. Portfolio Check (10 minutes)
    * Give access to your portfolio to another person in your group and all check at the same time, then feedback
2. Weekly Meeting Record (10 minutes)
    * In your small group share one weekly meeting cycle each (record and reflection) and identify and share good practice
3. Teaching File Snapshot of Good Practice – (20 minutes)
    1. Share one example of formal planning (or otherwise) that you have taught and compare good practice. (Use the headings on the Lesson Planning Form to scaffold your discussions)
    2. Share the lesson evaluation from this lesson – how well implemented was your plan?
4. Subject Knowledge and Pedagogical Content Knowledge Development (15 minutes)
    1.  Compare strategies and types of evidence used to demonstrate your progress, highlighting any good examples of progress and its impact on pupil learning in or outside the classroom.
    2. Share a good resource for a topic that you have taught.
5. Complete Peer Review Reflection (5 minutes)

Your completed Peer Review Reflection must be completed as part of the Personal and Professional Development Day and before your tutorial with your tutor.


Peer Review Individual Reflection
---------------------------------

As a result of your peer review, reflect on what you have learnt, noting examples of shared good pedagogy and/or strategies you want to implement into your practice. You may wish to consider some of these questions to support your peer review reflection:

* Peer Tutorial discussion peers’ names:
* What do you wish to take forward from today’s Peer Review to aid the development of your practice?
* Which learning theories/academic literature and papers have had the greatest impact on your work and why?
* How is effective pupil learning developed?
* What effective strategies are you implementing regarding planning a sequence of lessons? How does this fit with short term planning?
* What strategies are you effectively employing to support an individual’s learning?

Ensure a record of these reflections are placed in your portfolio
