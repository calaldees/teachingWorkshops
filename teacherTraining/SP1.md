Introductions
-------------

### Who am I?

My background
* 7 years teaching ICT and Computing in secondary schools - Practical battle experience
* 10 years as a senior developer in central London across a range of domains
* (2 years sessions) + 1 year formally as Lecturer in Education.
* My weakness is _cutting edge research_ and _teaching theory_
    * I will constantly working towards this the rest of my career

I have my own ideas about how to teach computing
* Multiple languages at once
* Freedom (self direct-ish)/project based/Creativity (removal of hierarchy)
* Unit tests, Pair programming (talking about code and collaborating), Version control
But this course is not about my _opinions_ or about my preferred teaching methods.
You must develop your own critically to develop your own subject pedagogy knowledge.

### Who are you?

TASK: 120 second summary
* Rough background (education, work)
* Course: PGCE, 7-14 or SchoolDirect?
* What are you exited about this year
* What are you fearful about this year (we are all vulnerable)

<sub>side-note: Computing teachers mindsets - tech workers? - be mindful - other subject practitioners can feel trapped in the profession</sub>

The burden of learning to teach - the _expert beginner_
Primary->Secondary->Uni->Carear1Employment1->Carear2Employment2->Retraining->Carear2Employment1

### Thumb-up-o-meter

* Multiple languages?
* Version control?
* Linux?


### Lighthouse statement

You've made a lighthouse statement about _who you are_ and _why you want to teach_.
I made a lighthouse statement at the start of my teacher training PGCE.
I read it back at the end of my PGCE year.
I could not identify with it.
It was some words that babaled about _making a difference_. It was unstructured idealist nonsense.
I could not believe how much the year had changed me.

This year will change you.

> When you learn something, you are permanently changed.

### Know Thyself (10min)

* [Know Thyself](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:intro-exercises) Chapter 1 - Greg Wilson
    * What do you most want to teach?
    * Who do you most want to teach?
    * Why do you want to teach?
    * How will you know if you're teaching well?
    * What do you most want to learn about teaching and learning
    * What is one specific thing you believe about teaching and learning?

TASK: answer the questions above - save them safley - we will reflect on these at the end of the course


#### You will outgrow my support

Right now I might look to you like some super-human teaching deity. By the end of this course you will feel completely differently. I'm just some dude doing a job I like. By the end of this year you will have outgrown the support I can give you. At the celebration day at the end of the course we will just be a bunch of people sitting around and talking about education.



Why learn computing (10min)
-------------------

* [Why learn computing](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:intro-exercises) Chapter 1 - Greg Wilson
    * > Politicians, business leaders, and educators often say that people should learn to program because the jobs of the future will require it. 
      > However, as Benjamin Doxtdator pointed out, many of those claims are built on shaky ground. 
      > Even if they were true, education shouldnâ€™t prepare people for the jobs of the future: it should give them the power to decide what kinds of jobs there are and to ensure that those jobs are worth doing. And as Mark Guzdial points out, there are actually many reasons to learn how to program:

* To understand our world.
* To study and understand processes.
* To be able to ask questions about the influences on their lives.
* To use an important new form of literacy.
* To have a new way to learn art, music, science, and mathematics.
* As a job skill.
* To use computers better.
* As a medium in which to learn problem-solving.

TASK: Complete the grid

* Which points are closely aligned in importance (i.e. on the diagonal in your grid)?
* Which points are misaligned (i.e. in the off-diagonal corners)?
* How should this affect what you teach?
