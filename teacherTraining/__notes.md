Facts and Process's can me memorise
concept cannot (personal understanding)

Facts and process's can be assessed
concepts cannot

Virtual Oppertunities
* polling 
    * anonymouse (REALLY helpful - try out their thinking - some never responded)
    * electronic
* non visual environenmt (We always scan for students that looked puzzled or rolling their eyes, no contention over order of hands up)
    * explitit instructions (clearer?)
    * focus (break things up a LOT more, which are bits that need an instructor and what can they do on their own. Do we need to be there)
    * (interaction via chat to develop point)
* Spoken and written interaction

Struggle
* There is a lot more communication that goes on face-to-face
* Disscussions take time
    * Overhead of turning mic's on etc
* Loose the ping pong of intereacting with students

Having another college in the class is so important!!!!

Concepts must come first
Psycology of learning computing
facts about the colour 'red' (255,0,0) - concept comes first

You were such an effective/reflective team.

The concept of 'Pair teaching' is incredibly powerful.

(In professional software engineering, modern practice is to 'Pair Program' for all tasks)

Long form responses? go Async?

We must trust our leaners as adults, they can chat in a chat room while the class is happening

Talk openly about your pedagogy to your students

"Tell me about what you have done when you encountered xyz"
More then 'your' way ..

How could we foster a culture of Peer consultation with our teaching practice across the department?

Team teaching - pair!!
