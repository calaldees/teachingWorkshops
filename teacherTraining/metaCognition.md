Meta-cognition
==============

* Thinking about 'Thinking'
    * Reflection is a meta-cognitive skill
* We should set time aside to explicitly teach/name/model metacognitive skills

ITT CCF 4.5
> Explicitly teaching pupils metacognitive strategies linked to subject knowledge, including how to plan, monitor and evaluate, supports independence and academic success

> Evidence suggests the use of ‘metacognitive strategies’ – which get pupils to think about their own learning - can be worth the equivalent of an additional +7 months’ progress when used well.
> However, while the potential impact of these approaches is very high, particularly for disadvantaged pupils, less is known about how to apply them effectively in the classroom.

> metacognitive strategies should be taught in conjunction with specific subject content as pupils find it hard to transfer these generic tips to specific tasks.

* Teachers should support pupils to plan, monitor, and evaluate their learning
* Explicitly teach pupils metacognitive strategies, including how to plan, monitor, and evaluate their learning
* Teachers should verbalise their metacognitive thinking (‘What do I know about problems like this? What ways of solving them have I used before?’) as they approach and work through a task.
* dialogue needs to be purposeful, with teachers guiding and supporting the conversation 
* Carefully designed guided practice, with support gradually withdrawn as the pupil becomes proficient, can allow pupils to develop skills and strategies before applying them in independent practice.
* Metacognition shouldn’t be an ‘extra’ task for teachers to do but should be built into their teaching activities

    * > for students to become more metacognitive, they must be taught the concept and its language explicitly (Pintrich, 2002; Tanner, 2012), 
    * > most effective when it is adapted to reflect the specific learning contexts of a specific topic, course, or discipline (Zohar & David, 2009).

Volet described "metacognitive strategies" in teaching and learning as the use of metacognition elements to aid learning, including checking, planning, selecting, monitoring, evaluating and revising.

### Some ideas of mine

* What was the hardest thing about this project? Why was this the hardest thing? What skills would have helped you if you had had them? How would you have go those skills? What could you do in the next project to improve?
* Planning - Always seek to clarify the problem
    * How will you know the task is complete?
    * Be clear about your expected inputs and outputs and why
    * Pro: Write your unittests before you start coding
* Assess yourself? peer assessment?
    * Number of lines of code
    * Readability (variable names)
    * Comments
* We are continuing this project next session - How can I prepare for next session?
    * What resources are available to you?
    * What action should I take?

You can tell your students all of these things, but would it be more powerful if you got them to ask themselves the questions first?

We should set time aside to explicitly teach/name/model metacognitive skills


### Notes of my reading (just for reference)

* [Scaffolding by novice and expert teachers: The difference](https://impact.chartered.college/article/scaffolding-by-novice-expert-teachers-difference/) Lorna Shires - September 2020 - Chartered College of Teaching
    4. Expert teachers offered a metacommentary throughout the lessons that had the aim of ensuring that students trusted the teachers to take them through the process of learning something new
    * > students developed something that I came to call subject agency – the ability of pupils to develop the capacity to do something with the knowledge for themselves. Subject agency reflected how the teachers were hugely motivated by their own love of the subject
    * > Expert teachers were thinking about the process of teaching using the metaphor of scaffolding as a temporary adaptive structure (Shvarts and Bakker, 2019).
    * _Trust_ is a key factor

* [Making sense of metacognition](https://impact.chartered.college/article/quigley-stringer-making-sense-metacognition/) - May 2018 Impact Charatered College of Teaching
    * Misconception 1: Metacognition is a general skill that should be taught separately from subject knowledge
    * Misconception 2: Metacognition represents ‘higher order’ thinking and is therefore more important than mere cognition or subject knowledge
    * Misconception 3: Metacognition is only developed in older pupils
    * > Recommendations from the evidence would suggest that teachers can be much more deliberate about teaching metacognitive awareness in the crucible of the classroom

    * My computing notes inspired by article above
        * Stage 1 Understand the problem
            * Doctest? Expected input, expected output
        * Stage 2 Devise a plan
            * Have we seen something similar?
            * Can we break it down into steps?
                * Diagrams? psudo code
        * Stage 3 Implement the plan
            * Is it working? Do we need a new plan?
        * Stage 4 Reflecting
            * Dose your answer make sense?
            * Are there any inefficiencies? repetition?
            * Can any of the variables be renamed to make it clearer?
            * Can anything be broken down further into functions?
            * Could any of these be reused in other projects?

Discuss with then - How are we going to learn something effectivly? concreat preparation
Ask them "why did you get it wrong"? 
"how could this be corrected"
"how could you avoid this mistake in future topics"?
