KSQ 4: What is education?

* What, and how, has teaching and learning of subject been affected in this area/my placement school?
* What are current subject practices?
* What are the skills of reasoning and problem solving in Computer Science and how are computing departments addressing these? (KS3/KS4/KS5)
* Planning for progression - Schemes of Work - Building schemata
    * Pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models
* Exploring strategies that aid teaching and learning including contextualised, independent, discovery
* Making effective use of a lesson plan

* Planning to aid learning in Computing
    * Schoolâ€™s curriculum materials inform lesson preparation
    * coherent wider vision for successful learning
* Introduction to PRIMM pedagogy

Next week 
KSQ 5: How do children learn?

* We need to elect a subject rep
* Subject knowledge audit completed + consent form + questionnaire


* Tasks:
    * Can you acquire the department SOW and subject curriculum overview for KS3 (we will be talking about schemes of work and lesson planning next session SP4)
    * Introductory email to me cc-ing in your subject mentor
* Initial observation questions that could help focus your attention:
    * How do teachers transition students to/from using computers?
    * What wall displays are in place - are they actively used in lessons?
    * What % of the time are students using computers? Is this different from different year groups?
    * Do they highlight key vocabulary/language?
    * How many segments are their in lessons?
    * What % of time are TeacherTalking, StudentsCollaborating, StudentsIndependent
* Bigger questions (as the course progress's):
    * What provision is there for clubs/extra activities?
    * How do your department collaborate/co-ordinate with other subjects?

* Next week

* [Subject Pedagogy Research Proposal: Microsoft Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPage.aspx?lang=en-GB&origin=OfficeDotCom&route=Start#FormId=2rIgA90iq02MIW5kS6FPE4bZosdBzY5AvRurHpjUivVUQ0JRMFNOREUwNlBTVkxLREQ5UDFQVDVaRC4u)
    * Area of the investigation - Keep this quite broad
    * Key reading related to the area - Outline at least three or four key texts that you have looked at for this. Ideally, this should include specific research articles
    * Focus of the area of enquiry/specific research question - What is the precise question or key issue that you wish to explore? Can you phrase it as a research question?
    * Possible ethical issues - The key ethical issues are informed consent, protection of children, anonymity and confidentiality, and payment of research participants. In the case of a literature review, as you are only using secondary data and that there are no participants involved, ethical clearance is not required. However, it is good practice to make a general statement to show that you have considered ethics in light of the research you are carrying out.

* Weekley reflections and pair collaboration (30min)
    * Normally  20min (10min each) - but adding bonus task
    * What are the differences between your schools? (as many things as you can identify)
