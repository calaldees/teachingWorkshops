Computer Science Specific Pedagogy (2 Hours)
==================================

If students can program, then they express higher levels of theory by building the solutions. 
It is therefore important to build students programming proficiency.

ITT CCF 4.2
> Effective teachers introduce new material in steps, explicitly linking new ideas to what has been previously studied and learned

ITT CCF 4.3
> Modelling helps pupils understand new processes and ideas; good models make abstract ideas concrete and accessible.

ITT CCF 4.4
> Guides, scaffolds and worked examples can help pupils apply new ideas, but should be gradually removed as pupil expertise increases

Total 2 hours

Part 1
------

Two groups research and present

TASK: 
* Split the group into two breakout groups
* Read (30 min)
    * Assign one to read PRIMM
    * Assign another to read Meta-cognition
* Present (30 min?)
    * Ask each group to screen share and verbalise/recall their summary (10 min per group)
        * One member could screen share - the others chip in points/thoughts - it would be good if all members could have a insight or contribution


PRIMM (Sue Sentence 2019)

ITT CCF 2.9
> Worked examples that take pupils through each step of a new process are also likely to support pupils to learn


* Predict
* Run
* Investigate
* Modify
* Make

TASK: Read PRIMM quick read.

* Take fear out of programming - don't start with a blank editor
* Always provide a base program that runs
* Build on top of it incrementally

    * Coding is Hard - but why? - is it difficult or is it taught badly
    * misconceptions
        * Assignment `=` or `==`
        * Nasty errors - emotionally difficult
    * _Copy this code_ - to much of a jump
    * Reading code before you can write it
    * Collaboratively talk about programs - "rubber duck debugging"
    * Python - tight - however - lots of concepts in one line
    * Starting point - take out the emotional burden of building from scratch
    * Gradually take ownership of a program
    * Predict - together think, what will it do
        * Meaningful variable names
        * Shape of code?
    * Run - copy paste run
    * Investigate - unpick _why_
        * What does that block do
        * What would happen if reverse two lines
        * 
    * Modify
        * Add an extra feature
        * gradual transfer of ownership <-- CRITICAL!
    * Make - design and make
        * use the skills of the first 4 steps
        * a big leap - needs to be scaffolded
    * Variations - Craig and Dave's TIME - Pete Dren KPRIDE - EPIC
    * Steps that are not too huge a jump - cognitive load theory
    * Importance of classroom discussion - language of their subject
        * Talking about a program really solidify ideas - rubber duck
        * Vocabulary
            * Variables, output, input, conditions, iteration, assignment
    * Research interview using PRIMM
        * Language to talk about code
        * Experienced teachers model vocabulary
        * Meta discourse - talk about the words that you are using
            * _Condition_ - well I condition my hair - _selection_

    * Try, Investigate, Make and Evaluate
        * Try
            * Predict what a program will do. Type or paste the code and give it a try.
        * Investigate
            * Comprehend the code. Modify the code. Debug code.
            * Structure, purpose, reason, realtion, approach
        * Make
            * Design an algorithm. Code the solution.
            * > students choose the problems they want to solve, aiming for a total of 6 points in each objective
        * Evaluation
            * Test the code. Reflect on the approach. Refine the code
    * Role of teacher
        * Immediate oral feedback will be far more useful to the student than written feedback
        * If you are not leading programming from the front of the class and students are working on different tasks at the same time, what does the teacher do?
        * Programming taught from the front of the class at best only ever effectively teaches a third of the class. Some can already progress further beyond what you are explaining and some are already lost and need additional support. Allowing students to learn independently at their own pace and choose their own challenges allows greater flexibility for the teacher to stretch and support individual students.
        * The role of the teacher is to maintain pace, provide individual interventions when students are stuck, review completed objectives and track progress.
        * Using these resources, students that are absent from class are not disadvantaged and can even continue their work at home. If a question is too difficult to answer, or a problem is too difficult to solve, these can be left to be discussed with the teacher. The student can still move on to the next objective or problem.

Fuller Verb Model
-----------------

ITT CCF 3.7
> In all subject areas, pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (or “schemata”); carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important.

### TASK

(Adapted from NCCE Outstanding Programming Pedagogies course)

### Task 1 (15 min)
Read the various _Verbs_ and their extended descriptions that relate to teaching programming 

* Recognise
    * Base knowledge and vocabulary for the domain
        * Provide as much information you can about the construct being studied.  
        * This provides opportunities for students to make extended use of constructs knowing how they will develop and become more complex.  
        * Misconceptions can be covered and common problems that are experienced so that students can build resilience, knowing that mistakes and problems they encounter are not uncommon.
* Present
    * Explain a solution to others
        * Display code which extends their current knowledge of a given programming construct.
        * Students are to explain the code to a peer within a given constraint such as number of words, sentences or within a given time.
        * This aids their skills in explain errors that they might come across to teachers and peers, providing a greater focus on the key area for amendment.
        * This skill provides opportunities for students to read code, explore different styles of coding and reinforce their understanding of a construct.
* Relate
    * Understand solution in context of others
        * Students can be directed to different solutions to the same problem, sharing which approach might be best in terms of amount of code, time to develop, complexity and efficiency.  
        * They can take a given solution and adapt it to meet the needs of a next context, further developing their generalisation skills.
* Refactor
    * Redesign a solution for optimisation
        * A new concept, one which will significantly stretch student’s knowledge can be demonstrated or shown so that the next level of understanding can begin with more advanced uses of programming constructs.
        * Often there will be a focus on the effectiveness or efficiency of a solution by considering such alternative techniques.
* Model
    * Illustrate or implement an abstraction of a problem
        * A concept can be provided either in written or diagrammatic form.
        * This enforces the need for students to consider what constructs can be combined to produce algorithms capable of solving the given concept in a manner that is computable.
        * Students benefit from seeing how real life concepts and models can be realised by applying the correct logic in order to develop effective and efficient solutions.
* Implement
    * Put a completed design into code 
        * Provide partially completed or abstracted designs or provide a written or bulleted summary to be translated into code.
        * This provides a challenge where students can feel supported from the ‘Know’ elements by constructing suitable algorithms with clear success criteria or requirements.
        * This provides students with the opportunity to focus on logic and syntax and develop independence by leaning on their debugging and logic skills.
* Design
    * Devise a solution structure
        * Provide a scenario for students to abstract and produce a design.
        * This could be in the form of a flowchart, pseudo code.
        * This enables students to create mental models, ask good questions in order to devise designs which are efficient and map effectively to programming constructs in the form of algorithms.
* Trace
    * Desk-check a solution
        * Code can be provided with given inputs and students need to predict the output or vice-versa.
        * This provides opportunities for students to read code, get best practice in terms of structure and to build confidence by understanding or predicting logic without the need to be able to write the construct syntactically.
        * This supports their ability to read different styles of coding among their peers and make better plans before implementation.
* Apply
    * Use a solution as a component in a problem
        * Offer a sub-section of code or part of a design for students to devise a solution by applying the construct accordingly.
        * This provides opportunities for students to build larger programs and exploring the depth of constructs in order to develop more complex and modular solutions.
* Debug
    * Both detect and correct flaws in design 
        * Provide opportunities for students to find errors in code or provide two examples and ask which example is free of code errors.
        * Students can also be asked to find one or more logical and syntax errors.
        * This develops their skills in reading code and building their independence so that the can spot and debug their own programs.
        * Students could also sabotage working code in order for their peers to unpick errors and return to working order.
* Adapt
    * Modify a solution for other domains
        * Students can also be provided with a solution for a given domain and adjust the code in order for the logic to remain the same but for the needs of a new scenario to be met.
        * This develops pupils understanding of how programming constructs can be applied to a range of domains and also enables them to identify the strengths of specific constructs through the exploration of examples that pose similar problems.
* Translate
    * Convert from block, text, flowchart, pseudo code and vice-versa
        * Provide examples of designs in pseudo and flowchart form with tasks for students to implement the designs in code and vice-versa.
        * This develops student’s ability to translate different designs and apply and combine programming constructs in line with logical thought.
* Analyse
    * probe the time complexity of a solution
        * Code snippets or algorithms can be given or displayed to students, giving them the opportunity to share their understanding and thoroughly investigate components of a construct or algorithm, decomposing parts.
        * From this, students make greater associations between different constructs and how they can combine effectively to create algorithms.

### Task 2 (15 min)

* Setup a group document
* In groups of 3: You are going to attempt to place the verbs in this grid 
    * Some cells have no verbs
    * Some cells have multiple verbs

| Apply  |                |                |                |                |
| Know   |                |                |                |                |
