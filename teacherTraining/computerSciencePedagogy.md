Computer Science Specific Pedagogy
==================================

If students can program, then they express higher levels of theory by building the solutions. 
It is therefore important to build students programming proficiency.

ITT CCF 4.2
> Effective teachers introduce new material in steps, explicitly linking new ideas to what has been previously studied and learned

ITT CCF 4.3
> Modelling helps pupils understand new processes and ideas; good models make abstract ideas concrete and accessible.

ITT CCF 4.4
> Guides, scaffolds and worked examples can help pupils apply new ideas, but should be gradually removed as pupil expertise increases

        * If you are not leading programming from the front of the class and students are working on different tasks at the same time, what does the teacher do?
        * Programming taught from the front of the class at best only ever effectively teaches a third of the class. Some can already progress further beyond what you are explaining and some are already lost and need additional support. Allowing students to learn independently at their own pace and choose their own challenges allows greater flexibility for the teacher to stretch and support individual students.
        * The role of the teacher is to maintain pace, provide individual interventions when students are stuck, review completed objectives and track progress.
        * Using these resources, students that are absent from class are not disadvantaged and can even continue their work at home. If a question is too difficult to answer, or a problem is too difficult to solve, these can be left to be discussed with the teacher. The student can still move on to the next objective or problem.

### TASK

(Adapted from NCCE Outstanding Programming Pedagogies course)

### Task 1 (15 min)
Read the various _Verbs_ and their extended descriptions that relate to teaching programming 

* Recognise
    * Base knowledge and vocabulary for the domain
        * Provide as much information you can about the construct being studied.  
        * This provides opportunities for students to make extended use of constructs knowing how they will develop and become more complex.  
        * Misconceptions can be covered and common problems that are experienced so that students can build resilience, knowing that mistakes and problems they encounter are not uncommon.
* Present
    * Explain a solution to others
        * Display code which extends their current knowledge of a given programming construct.
        * Students are to explain the code to a peer within a given constraint such as number of words, sentences or within a given time.
        * This aids their skills in explain errors that they might come across to teachers and peers, providing a greater focus on the key area for amendment.
        * This skill provides opportunities for students to read code, explore different styles of coding and reinforce their understanding of a construct.
* Relate
    * Understand solution in context of others
        * Students can be directed to different solutions to the same problem, sharing which approach might be best in terms of amount of code, time to develop, complexity and efficiency.  
        * They can take a given solution and adapt it to meet the needs of a next context, further developing their generalisation skills.
* Refactor
    * Redesign a solution for optimisation
        * A new concept, one which will significantly stretch student’s knowledge can be demonstrated or shown so that the next level of understanding can begin with more advanced uses of programming constructs.
        * Often there will be a focus on the effectiveness or efficiency of a solution by considering such alternative techniques.
* Model
    * Illustrate or implement an abstraction of a problem
        * A concept can be provided either in written or diagrammatic form.
        * This enforces the need for students to consider what constructs can be combined to produce algorithms capable of solving the given concept in a manner that is computable.
        * Students benefit from seeing how real life concepts and models can be realised by applying the correct logic in order to develop effective and efficient solutions.
* Implement
    * Put a completed design into code 
        * Provide partially completed or abstracted designs or provide a written or bulleted summary to be translated into code.
        * This provides a challenge where students can feel supported from the ‘Know’ elements by constructing suitable algorithms with clear success criteria or requirements.
        * This provides students with the opportunity to focus on logic and syntax and develop independence by leaning on their debugging and logic skills.
* Design
    * Devise a solution structure
        * Provide a scenario for students to abstract and produce a design.
        * This could be in the form of a flowchart, pseudo code.
        * This enables students to create mental models, ask good questions in order to devise designs which are efficient and map effectively to programming constructs in the form of algorithms.
* Trace
    * Desk-check a solution
        * Code can be provided with given inputs and students need to predict the output or vice-versa.
        * This provides opportunities for students to read code, get best practice in terms of structure and to build confidence by understanding or predicting logic without the need to be able to write the construct syntactically.
        * This supports their ability to read different styles of coding among their peers and make better plans before implementation.
* Apply
    * Use a solution as a component in a problem
        * Offer a sub-section of code or part of a design for students to devise a solution by applying the construct accordingly.
        * This provides opportunities for students to build larger programs and exploring the depth of constructs in order to develop more complex and modular solutions.
* Debug
    * Both detect and correct flaws in design 
        * Provide opportunities for students to find errors in code or provide two examples and ask which example is free of code errors.
        * Students can also be asked to find one or more logical and syntax errors.
        * This develops their skills in reading code and building their independence so that the can spot and debug their own programs.
        * Students could also sabotage working code in order for their peers to unpick errors and return to working order.
* Adapt
    * Modify a solution for other domains
        * Students can also be provided with a solution for a given domain and adjust the code in order for the logic to remain the same but for the needs of a new scenario to be met.
        * This develops pupils understanding of how programming constructs can be applied to a range of domains and also enables them to identify the strengths of specific constructs through the exploration of examples that pose similar problems.
* Translate
    * Convert from block, text, flowchart, pseudo code and vice-versa
        * Provide examples of designs in pseudo and flowchart form with tasks for students to implement the designs in code and vice-versa.
        * This develops student’s ability to translate different designs and apply and combine programming constructs in line with logical thought.
* Analyse
    * probe the time complexity of a solution
        * Code snippets or algorithms can be given or displayed to students, giving them the opportunity to share their understanding and thoroughly investigate components of a construct or algorithm, decomposing parts.
        * From this, students make greater associations between different constructs and how they can combine effectively to create algorithms.

    2. Targeted tasks: students are given a short task, e.g. fix buggy code, Parsons problems;
    3. Shared coding: the teacher thinks aloud as they design and write code, sometimes called demonstrating or live coding, e.g. teacher models how to write a program;
    4. Project-based: students are provided with a project goal and create a solution, e.g.create a quiz in Scratch;
    5. Inquiry-based: students consider a scenario or question and create a solution, e.g. explore a set of code commands and discover ways to use them;
    6. Tinkering: completely unstructured student-led exploration, e.g. explore a software”

    * Learner rearranges the lines of code to solve the task
    * benefit of Parson’s Problems is that the learner is focusing on the structure and logic of blocks of code, rather than the syntax of individual text elements (atoms). The process reduces the cognitive load experienced by learners, allowing them to practise sequencing and problem-solving with code.

    * Reading code is harder than writing code
    * We are VERY bad at teaching learners to read code
    * a strong focus on creating code, very often ‘green-field’ code, starting from a specification or a set of tests. 
        * This leads to the fact that programmers in generally are really poorly equipped to read code, even their own code, but especially code written by others.
    * novices read code more linearly than expert programmers.
        * Learning to follow the call stack it a thing that comes with experience
    * Deliberate Reading
        * Reading Questions:
            * What is the first thing that jumps out at me? Why?
            * What’s the next thing I notice? Are these two things connected? How?
            * Do they seem to be saying different things?
        * These sentences encourage and train ‘scanning’ behaviour, which we know is a thing programmers do. 
        * The beautiful thing about this technique is that is gives me a thing “to do” when reading code. Rather than mindlessly scrolling thought the code,
    * Relational-Text
        * Link each occurrence of a variable with it's declaration
