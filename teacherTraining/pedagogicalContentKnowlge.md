Pedagogical Content Knowledge
=============================

* What is Computer Science specific pedagogy and how is it defined in subject research?
* Differences between _subject knowledge_ and _subject pedagogy_
* Introduction to Shulman’s SK and PCK theory – an example of theory used in educational research and practice
    * Identifying conceptions of SK and PCK and own development



* National Curriculum
    * > high-quality computing education equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world
    * > able to use, and express themselves and develop their ideas through, information and communication technology

    * > The idea that “teaching thinking” is appropriate in elementary school does have some antecedents but in 1970 it was certainly not current in the mainstream of American education circles

    * Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK; Koehler & Mishra, 2008; Mishra & Koehler, 2006) is probably the most prominent model of teacher expertise regarding the educational use of digital technologies 
    * Knowledge framework proposed by Shulman (1986, 1987), teachers need to combine different knowledge dimensions to effectively teach with technology. These include the three core components of 
        * pedagogical knowledge (PK)
        * content knowledge (CK)
        * technological knowledge (TK)
    * In addition, there are three first level hybrid components formed at their intersections, namely 
        * pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), 
        * technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK), 
        * technological content knowledge (TCK). 
    * These combine into the second level hybrid component, technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK)
    * Existing questionnaires have been criticized regarding the fuzzy, technology-unspecific, and content-agnostic wording of questionnaire items, which ask participants to rate the “appropriateness” of their competencies 
    * self-evaluated knowledge is relative to the extent of a person's knowledge itself.
    * This “unskilled and unaware” bias has been recognized in research on TPACK as well: 
    * Drummond and Sweeney (2017) showed that self-reported TPACK of pre-service teachers revealed only a weak correlation with a more objective, fact-based knowledge test on TPACK
    *  Starkey (2019) points out, TPACK needs to be enacted by three different types of competencies: the ability to use particular technologies as a teacher, the ability to decide which technology to use for a specific teaching purpose, and the ability to guide and support students when learning with digital tools.
    * Krauskopf and Forssell (2018) propose that self-report questionnaires are more likely to measure confidence and self-efficacy with regard to the TPACK domains rather than actual knowledge

    * PCK by proxy
    * There is an unheard commentary that is a part of any shared lesson resource
        * You would normally have this by talking to the other teacher
    * Lesson resources are missing _pedagogical metadata_
    * _Why_ we do what we do
    * Pedagogical reasoning - Know how to:
        * Know what you need to be able to teach
        * Know how to find it
        * How to repurpose it
        * How to teach with it

New rule:-
All materials produced in school are Crown Copyright and must be made available on a public facing website in an editable format.
If DfE is serious about reducing teacher workload this would do it.

Mark Enser @EnserMark
I'm not sure this would help workload. Geography teachers are great at uploading their resources on to free sharing sites but the time it has taken me to find something I want to use is always more than the time it would take me to produce it myself.
