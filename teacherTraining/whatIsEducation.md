History of Computing education in the UK
----------------------------------------

* [Shut down or restart? The way forward for computing in UK schools](https://royalsociety.org/~/media/education/computing-in-schools/2012-01-12-summary.pdf) 2012 Recommended reforms
* [School ICT to be replaced by computer science programme](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-16493929) 2012 'Slaves to the interface'
* [Bricklayers to Architects](https://learn.canterbury.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-2641359-dt-content-rid-3959448_1/courses/E20MTETT4SPD/Bricklayers%20to%20Architects%20-%20Jones.pdf) Page 7/8
    *   > We have many individuals who are able to use applications to varying degrees of proficiency (bricklayers) 
        > but do we have enough people capable of building the applications and hardware for the next generation of users (architects)? 
        > From the UK government’s perspective, we do not produce a sufficient number of programmers and hardware engineers. 
    *   > The future looks to be interesting. 
        > Already there are rumblings that there are woefully small numbers of suitable graduates entering CS teacher training.
        > Even if the number were to rise substantially, 
        > it would take some years for expertise to be built and suggested syllabi to embed

* Most Computing teachers have not come from a Computing background. They have come from other subjects.
* All _ICT teachers_ in the country were told "You now teach Computing"


What is a curriculum/subject curriculum?
----------------------------------------

The entire ethos/goals of a course of education.

* [The National Curriculum: subjects](https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum/key-stage-3-and-4)
    * Computing is a Foundation subject
    * Academies/Public/Private/Independent don't need to teach computing
* [National Curriculum: computing programmes of study](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study)
    * The opening line ... is majestic!
    * > A high-quality computing education equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world.

TASK: The National Curriculum is a page of A4? How would you report a grade to your school and to parents?
Discussion


(Many people have spent 100's of hours deliberating over mechanisms to do this. I'm asking you, as beginners to do this in 10min. It's a deliberately overwhelming task to get you to understand the magnitude of the problem)

### National Curriculum Assessment

More on assessment in a later session

"How do you report grades/progress in KS3" - however you like - it's the wild west!

Some just use GCSE grades for KS3. This is not what GCSE grades were designed for - there is some missing overlap KS3/KS4

### School inspection criteria for Computing

Copy paste from
[computingAcrossCurriculum.md](./computingAcrossCurriculum.md) #Ofsted and Computing (how link to heading?)

From Ofsted Education Inspection Framework

* Teaching in computing is good or better when:
    * it is rooted in the development of pupils’ understanding of important concepts and progression within the lesson and over time; it enables pupils to make connections between individual topics and to see the ‘big picture’
    * teachers use a very wide range of innovative and imaginative resources and teaching strategies to stimulate pupils’ active participation in their learning and secure good or better progress across all aspects of the subject.
* The computing curriculum is good or better when:
    * the contexts in which computing is taught are relevant to pupils’ lives and reflect the increasing use of computing in the world of industry
    * excellent links are forged with other agencies and the wider community to provide a wide range of enrichment activities to promote pupils’ learning and engagement with the subject
    * links with other subjects in the school are productive in strengthening pupils’ learning in computing
* Leadership of computing is good or better when
    * there are effective strategies to delegate subject responsibilities where appropriate and to share good practice
    * computing has a very high profile in the life of the school
* Finally ...
    * E-safety is now considered in the inspection of all education remits including the early years sector, further education and skills, and initial teacher education.


Science Vs Engineering
----------------------

* [Computing Science or Engineering? Language](https://learn.canterbury.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-2641367-dt-content-rid-3959384_1/courses/E20MTETT4SPD/Is%20Computer%20Science%20a%20Science%20-%20Denning.pdf) Interview with Denning 2007
    * Because computers are man-made and not natural. We can't study them like a science. People in other fields think we are just programmers. We've be unsuccessful in communicating the breath and depth of our discipline
* [Knowing versus Doing: Academic and Vocational Education for Informatics in the UK](https://learn.canterbury.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-2641378-dt-content-rid-3959390_1/courses/E20MTETT4SPD/Knowing%20verses%20doing%20-%20Cowling.pdf) Cowling
    * vocational  (ie  concerned  with  developing  skills),
    * academic  (ie  concerned  with  developing knowledge) 
    * What if what we do needs both? These have converged.
    * > neither kind of course (academic or vocational) can be characterised simply in terms of equipping students with knowledge or skills.


Friction with Society
---------------------

Is Computing misunderstood?
Has technology corrupted education?

Computing in the curriculum has been criticized for not being relevant for all students.
* [Coding the curriculum: new computer science GCSE fails to make the grade](https://theconversation.com/coding-the-curriculum-new-computer-science-gcse-fails-to-make-the-grade-79780) 2017
* [Backlash against computing curriculum misses the point](https://theconversation.com/backlash-against-computing-curriculum-misses-the-point-22380) 2014
* [Rotten STEM: How Technology Corrupts Education](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/08/rotten-stem-how-technology-corrupts-education/) 2019 By Jared Woodard
* [Internet use reduces study skills in university students](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/01/200117085321.htm)

This was the pre-reading.

TASK: Discuss
1. What are the points raised in these articles?
2. How do your personal beliefs as a _Teacher of Computing_ intersect with the opinions displayed in these articles?
* As a group you must self balance - I want you facilitate equal contributions from everyone
* The outcome of this discussion will help inform how I plan future sessions
    * The task will be recorded
    * I will make notes on the quality of your contributions
    * Show me your note-taking skills, your retention and your higher order skills


Preparing students for a future we are unsure of
------------------------------------------------

Our technology/society is changing fast

* [When landlines were considered dangerous - BBC Ideas](https://www.bbc.co.uk/ideas/videos/when-landlines-were-considered-dangerous/p08dwnnz)
* > Low level coding jobs will be the first to go. Sysadmin, network architect, computer support. <sub>Rotten STEM</sub>


Computing Teacher: your role in a wider context
-----------------------------------------------

TASK: Visit the LASAR Site ... thoughts? comments?
Can Science and Religion be taught together?

* [LASAR (Learning about Science and Religion](https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/education/our-work/research-enterprise/learning-about-science-and-religion/learning-about-science-and-religion.aspx)
    * [Introducing epistemic insight into a PGCE course](https://www.epistemicinsight.com/introducing-epistemic-insight-into-a-pgce-course/)
        * Linking subject to _bigger questions_
    * [National Institute for Christian Education Research](https://blogs.canterbury.ac.uk/nicer/)
    * AI research - before we can have _artificial interference_ we need to define intelligence
    * [Joscha Bach: Artificial Consciousness and the Nature of Reality | Lex Fridman Podcast #101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-2P3MSZrBM)
        * 00:26:00, 01:56:00 The turing test - is a recursive test - it's a question for us to define ourselves
        * 01:14:00 The observation of _spirit as an operating system for an autonomous robot_ - plants - humans
        * 02:30:00 Study of _religion as software_ - rules/structure that lead to better outcomes
* Fundamental British Values (mentioned last week)



The attitude of the Teacher
---------------------------

* [The role of beliefs in teacher agency](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13540602.2015.1044325)
    * > The comparative lack of a clear vision about what education is for seems to seriously limit the possibilities for action to develop a good education

TASK: From todays session. 
1. Reflect on "clear vision about what education is"
2. Articulate how this will impact your teaching (actions/next-steps)
5min thinking/preparing.
Round-robin the group. 


Closing thoughts
----------------

### Access to information


We dreamed of a future where everyone had access to information. It would liberate the working class's.

We now have access ubiquitous to high quality information: YouTube, Learn-to-code resources, Wikipedia.

Is the average person smarter, better informed, more skilled?
The problem is not _access to information_.

### Clarification of reflection requirements

I used the term _assessment_ when I refereed to your reflections. This word has hard connotations that is not inline with the spirit of this initial communication.

To clarify: Your formal assessments for your course are detailed in your respective _Programme Handbook_ (see link above)

I have re-worded the segment below (from SP1) to reflect the original intention.

---
You need a note taking system.
Your note taking system should be online and transparent.
* Every subject session
    * You record - progress, evidence and actions
        * Action points
        * Reflections
    * Tutor records
        * Comments on each student for each session
        * Monitor Engagement
            * If I was asked 'How is StudentX engaging with the subject sessions'. I could respond by pointing them at your action points and reflections for each session.
        * I could be asked to justify your progress
            * e.g last year when lockdown happened - educators asked to predict on trajectory
            * I will be part of a panel of professionals that could be asked about your progress
---

In the context of blended/remote learning; I have no conventional feedback mechanisms for analysing engagement. I can't see facial expressions, I can't circulate round the room and see progress, I can't have causal/impromptu chats/catchups.
These reflections are a vital feedback mechanism for the analysis of a sessions impact.


### Clarification of reflection sharing workflow

Sharing resources/reflections
Blackboard Wiki Link

* Active/Current actions/tasks + Archived actions/tasks
* Group has access to your actions/reflections/resources
* Linked from the course blackboard wiki

DEMO Example


School Direct Experience share
------------------------------

PGCE students have not experienced a school setting.

> learning from experience is possible through theories of pedagogy,
> but pedagogy without experience is meaningless

Scales 2018


Subject Knowledge Audit
-----------------------

TASK: Set a personal target for one aspect of subject knowledge. We will come back to this at the end of the session.

* [Subject Knowledge Audit](https://learn.canterbury.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-2669165-dt-content-rid-3995226_1/xid-3995226_1)


Computing in schools
--------------------

What are the skills of reasoning and problem solving in Computer Science and how are computing departments addressing these?


* Computational Thinking
    * Components
        * Decomposition
        * Pattern Recognition
        * Abstraction
        * Algorithms
    * Info
        * [BBC Bitesize](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zp92mp3/revision/1)
        * [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking)
        * [Computational Thinking for a Computational World - digitalpromise.org](http://digitalpromise.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/dp-comp-thinking-v1r5.pdf)
        * > When defining what computational thinking is, it is also helpful to establish what it is not: that is, humans thinking like a computer. In fact, it is just the opposite. Computational thinking is a uniquely human ability


Schemes of Work
---------------
Planning for progression - Building schemata

A scheme of work implements a syllabus.

* [Scheme of work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_of_work)
    * > the structure and content of an academic course (syllabus). 
      > It splits an often-multi-year curriculum into deliverable units of work,
    * may include
        * Content 1
        * Objectives or Outcomes
        * Methods of delivery (student and teacher activity)
        * Assessment strategies
        * Resources

3 Years is a long time - time to forget - revisit topics multiple times over a 3 year period. e.g. Most years have some kind of web work, network work, programming work, etc

Cognitive Load Theory (explored more next session _howStudentsLearn_)
> Working memory should be seen as short term and finite, 
> whereas long-term memory can be seen as infinite. 


### What does a scheme of work look like?

Reminder: 
* KS3 == Year 7 to Year 9 (Level 0 to 1)
* KS4 == Year 10 and Year 11 (Level 1 to 2)

Pre-Task: Read the [KS3 Computing National Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study#key-stage-3)

TASK 1: 30min Find, Read, Analyse a number of KS3 Computing Schemes of work. Some examples are given below
Questions: 
1. How do the topics map to the National Curriculum?
2. What are the links between topics for year 1, 2, 3? 
    * What kind of progression are the creators thinking about?
3. What similarities/differences are there between the schemes of work?
4. Other than the sequence of content, what other teaching resources are provided?
5. Would you be able to teach any of these units with the resources provided?

TASK 2: 30min Discuss your findings with group, paste links in chat, share screens, talk about what you've found

### Scheme of work - example
Let's get some hands on!
We are going to explore a sample sequence of lessons

As well as free resources teachers share online. There are also paid for resources. Let's take a look!

* [Compute-IT](https://www.hoddereducation.co.uk/compute-it) - Computing for Key Stage 3
    * Endorsed by Computing at School
    * 3 textbook series (a Computing textbox for students. How much is a class set?)

Context Based Learning and Relevancy
------------------------------------

If Computing is to be relevant to world they live in, then make Computing encompasses the world. Wherever possible make Computing have _Cultural_ and/or _Community_ context

Young people can smell bullshit. 
Things I try to avoid:
* Fake themes
    * Harry potter tuck shop spreadsheets
    * Ponys
* Try to avoid computer games as a theme
    * These can alienate some demographics immediately
* Tasks for the sake of a task
    * "Add these number together" "Why" "Because it's the task"
    * (This is less of a problem for A-Level as they have chosen the subject)

### Real World Context for the Pen/Turtle skills learnt above
* Decomposition of geomentirc artwork - cultural context
    * [Theo van Doesburg](https://www.google.com/search?q=Theo+van+Doesburg&tbm=isch) (artist using geometric squares and lines)
    * [Simple Celtic artwork](https://www.google.com/search?q=simple+celtic+artwork&tbm=isch) (circles)
    * [Simple Islamic artwork](https://www.google.com/search?q=simple+islamic+artwork&tbm=isch) (repeating geometric patterns/colors)

### Relevancy/Context Reading

* [Top 12 Ways to Bring the Real World into Your Classroom](https://www.teachhub.com/classroom-activities/2010/05/top-12-ways-to-bring-the-real-world-into-your-classroom/)
* [Connecting Science Class to the Real-World](https://www.3plearning.com/blog/connecting-science-class-real-world/)

TASK: Now we have explored the skills and the context. Refer back to the Compute-IT teaching resource examples

### Examples
* [Locked-in syndrome](https://teachinglondoncomputing.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/activity-lockedin.pdf) activity disabled people communicating with blinking


Metaphors
---------

Physical metaphors are powerful links to the world-view of the student.
Always be 

* Computer Science Education: Perspectives on Teaching and Learning (2018): Sentance Sue, Barendsen Erik, Schulte Carsten
    * Computing can be very abstract subject
        * We can use Metaphors and Analogies
            * Physical tactile manifestation
    * We are trying to build _Competency Model_ rather than _tickbox objectives_
        * _Comprehension oriented_ not _Creation oriented_
    * To plan a lesson: start with _required competencies_ and work backwards from there

DEMO: box's metaphors



Plan a lesson - concept
-----------------------

TASK 1: 30min

* You've heard about National Curriculum, Context based learning, Metaphors
* Pick a concept from the KS3 National Curricumum (Some topic ideas are listed below)
* With that topic - come up with a _concept_ for a sequence of 2 or 3 tasks that convey a computing concept with a relevant context and/or a physical metaphors
* Can you highlight 2 or 3 technical computing terms you would convey in this lesson/
* Have a look at the "Lesson Planning Form"
    * [All Documentation (Padlet)](https://cccu.padlet.org/sharron_mackenzie1/nsp03wkvd1u5zx0z) Lesson Planning Form
    * Using the columns headings on page 2 - Can you put describe you 2 or 3 tasks

TASK 2: Present ideas to group
I will use the razzle dazzle name randomiser to select presenters
```python
import random
names = ['bob', 'jane', 'sally']
print(names.pop(random.randrange(len(names))))
```

### Loose KS3 topics/Skills
* Fetch decode execute cycle (von neumann)
* decimal
* binary - counting - convert dec-to-bin (subtract or divide method) - nibble 4bit, byte 8bit, overflow

* and, or, not gates (truth tables)
* loops, for, while, forever
* router lan/wan wi-fi isp tcp/ip (layers, error correction) packet/circuit switched ip-address(bytes), dns, subnets, mac address
* bubble sort - selection sort - time
* data types (int, string, date, image, sound)
* compression - lossy
* random
* recursion (10 green bottles) fibonacci, golden ratio (nature)
* cypher history, substitution caesar (excel lookup), symbols (pigpen), transitional
* bin to dec, ascii, hex
* data -> information (database) recipe allergy - search, redundant/duplicated data, validation
* linear search, binary search - time-it
* web-form to database
* half adder - full adder - latch circuit (1bit)



Teacher Standards
-----------------

* 2.f demonstrate knowledge and understanding of how pupils learn and how this impacts on teaching
* 3.c high standards of literacy, articulacy and the correct use of standard English, whatever the teacher’s specialist subject
* 4.d reflect systematically on the effectiveness of lessons and approaches to teaching
* 5.c demonstrate an awareness of the physical, social and intellectual development of children, and know how to adapt teaching to support pupils’ education at different stages of development
