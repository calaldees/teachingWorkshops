Session 4: What is Education (Part 2)
=====================================

### Objectives

* What, and how, has teaching and learning of subject been affected in this area/my placement school?
* What are current subject practices?
* What are the skills of reasoning and problem solving in Computer Science and how are computing departments addressing these?
    * Anticipating common misconceptions; a tool to aid learning
* Planning for progression - Schemes of Work - Building schemata
    * Pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models

Computing in schools
--------------------

What are the skills of reasoning and problem solving in Computer Science and how are computing departments addressing these?


* Computational Thinking
    * Components
        * Decomposition
        * Pattern Recognition
        * Abstraction
        * Algorithms
    * Info
        * [BBC Bitesize](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zp92mp3/revision/1)
        * [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking)
        * [Computational Thinking for a Computational World - digitalpromise.org](http://digitalpromise.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/dp-comp-thinking-v1r5.pdf)
        * > When defining what computational thinking is, it is also helpful to establish what it is not: that is, humans thinking like a computer. In fact, it is just the opposite. Computational thinking is a uniquely human ability


Schemes of Work
---------------
Planning for progression - Building schemata

A scheme of work implements a syllabus.

* [Scheme of work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_of_work)
    * > the structure and content of an academic course (syllabus). 
      > It splits an often-multi-year curriculum into deliverable units of work,
    * may include
        * Content 1
        * Objectives or Outcomes
        * Methods of delivery (student and teacher activity)
        * Assessment strategies
        * Resources

3 Years is a long time - time to forget - revisit topics multiple times over a 3 year period. e.g. Most years have some kind of web work, network work, programming work, etc

Cognitive Load Theory (explored more next session _howStudentsLearn_)
> Working memory should be seen as short term and finite, 
> whereas long-term memory can be seen as infinite. 


### What does a scheme of work look like?

Reminder: 
* KS3 == Year 7 to Year 9 (Level 0 to 1)
* KS4 == Year 10 and Year 11 (Level 1 to 2)

Pre-Task: Read the [KS3 Computing National Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study#key-stage-3)

TASK 1: 30min Find, Read, Analyse a number of KS3 Computing Schemes of work. Some examples are given below
Questions: 
1. How do the topics map to the National Curriculum?
2. What are the links between topics for year 1, 2, 3? 
    * What kind of progression are the creators thinking about?
3. What similarities/differences are there between the schemes of work?
4. Other than the sequence of content, what other teaching resources are provided?
5. Would you be able to teach any of these units with the resources provided?

TASK 2: 30min Discuss your findings with group, paste links in chat, share screens, talk about what you've found

### Scheme of work - example
Let's get some hands on!
We are going to explore a sample sequence of lessons

As well as free resources teachers share online. There are also paid for resources. Let's take a look!

* [Compute-IT](https://www.hoddereducation.co.uk/compute-it) - Computing for Key Stage 3
    * Endorsed by Computing at School
    * 3 textbook series (a Computing textbox for students. How much is a class set?)
    * Additional teaching resources online
    * Example Lessons
        * [Compute-IT 1: Unit 3 Lesson 1](http://my.dynamic-learning.co.uk/ViewLesson.aspx?i=DC06DC60-5268-417B-98AF-E81CE0E4B5D7&l=2556958&u=e27bc3ac-2aa5-4aa7-8601-b58991e957e9&vle=true)

Context Based Learning and Relevancy
------------------------------------

If Computing is to be relevant to world they live in, then make Computing encompasses the world. Wherever possible make Computing have _Cultural_ and/or _Community_ context

Young people can smell bullshit. 
Things I try to avoid:
* Fake themes
    * Harry potter tuck shop spreadsheets
    * Ponys
* Try to avoid computer games as a theme
    * These can alienate some demographics immediately
* Tasks for the sake of a task
    * "Add these number together" "Why" "Because it's the task"
    * (This is less of a problem for A-Level as they have chosen the subject)


* [Pete Dring](https://twitter.com/pddring/status/1405890060013146118)
    * > So proud of Holly and Kiri from @fulfordschool
      > who have just submitted their #MentalHealth app for the @AmazonUK
      > #LongitudeExplorerPrize. Can you spare a minute to vote for LESLI in the people's choice award? https://longitudeexplorer.challenges.org/vote/ 
      > #STEM @Stemettes #Tech4Good #CASChat
    * [longitudeexplorer.challenges.org/finalists-2021](https://longitudeexplorer.challenges.org/finalists-2021/)
        * Living Better: How can technology to help us stay happy and healthy in our day to day lives, and improve the lives of others?
        * Living Greener: How can technology help us protect our planet?
        * Living Together: How can technology help us live together and stay connected in a way that is easy, safe and environmentally friendly?
        * Living Longer: How can technology meet the needs of an ageing society?


### Real World Context for the Pen/Turtle skills learnt above
* Decomposition of geomentirc artwork - cultural context
    * [Theo van Doesburg](https://www.google.com/search?q=Theo+van+Doesburg&tbm=isch) (artist using geometric squares and lines)
    * [Simple Celtic artwork](https://www.google.com/search?q=simple+celtic+artwork&tbm=isch) (circles)
    * [Simple Islamic artwork](https://www.google.com/search?q=simple+islamic+artwork&tbm=isch) (repeating geometric patterns/colors)

### Relevancy/Context Reading

* [Top 12 Ways to Bring the Real World into Your Classroom](https://www.teachhub.com/classroom-activities/2010/05/top-12-ways-to-bring-the-real-world-into-your-classroom/)
* [Connecting Science Class to the Real-World](https://www.3plearning.com/blog/connecting-science-class-real-world/)

TASK: Now we have explored the skills and the context. Refer back to the Compute-IT teaching resource examples

### Examples
* [Locked-in syndrome](https://teachinglondoncomputing.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/activity-lockedin.pdf) activity disabled people communicating with blinking


Metaphors
---------

Physical metaphors are powerful links to the world-view of the student.
Always be 

* Computer Science Education: Perspectives on Teaching and Learning (2018): Sentance Sue, Barendsen Erik, Schulte Carsten
    * Computing can be very abstract subject
        * We can use Metaphors and Analogies
            * Physical tactile manifestation
    * We are trying to build _Competency Model_ rather than _tickbox objectives_
        * _Comprehension oriented_ not _Creation oriented_
    * To plan a lesson: start with _required competencies_ and work backwards from there

DEMO: box's metaphors



Plan a lesson - concept
-----------------------

TASK 1: 30min

* You've heard about National Curriculum, Context based learning, Metaphors
* Pick a concept from the KS3 National Curricumum (Some topic ideas are listed below)
* With that topic - come up with a _concept_ for a sequence of 2 or 3 tasks that convey a computing concept with a relevant context and/or a physical metaphors
* Can you highlight 2 or 3 technical computing terms you would convey in this lesson/
* Have a look at the "Lesson Planning Form"
    * [All Documentation (Padlet)](https://cccu.padlet.org/sharron_mackenzie1/nsp03wkvd1u5zx0z) Lesson Planning Form
    * Using the columns headings on page 2 - Can you put describe you 2 or 3 tasks

TASK 2: Present ideas to group
I will use the razzle dazzle name randomiser to select presenters
```python
import random
names = ['bob', 'jane', 'sally']
print(names.pop(random.randrange(len(names))))
```

How is knowing how computer work worthwhile for these students?

Computer Science is one size fits all - no foundation paper, no double GCSE module.
The paper is science, smart, hard, are you good enough?
(How do we foster creativity?)

Hard for students to learn by themselves - lots of abstract content

Pipeline problem with minorities
Inclusion

Not enough ICT - digital content creator
