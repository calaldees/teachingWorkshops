Advice to Students (15min lecture + 15min async reading)
--------------------------

* Are we careers experts in every profession? ... no ... we are teachers with limited knowledge of the entire economy.
* Do we know what the job market will be like in 20 years times and what skills will be in demand ... no ... 
* Should we be proclaiming to young people we know about their future ... probably not .. 

I think there are some fundamentals we can ascertain

* As professionals we are (part of) laying the foundations for the rest of their lives.
* As a professional we are guiding young people to be confident, competent, stable, communities.
* The idealistic "follow your dreams" feels selfish/elitist and only half the story.
* The full quote should read "Support your community, to facilitate following your dreams".

> Satisfaction comes from *experience* not _passion_

[So Good They Can't Ignore You](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/0349415862) - [Cal Newport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Newport)

> Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country

[Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_John_F._Kennedy)

I don't like the term _country_ - so I suggest a replacement of _community_

* There are plenty of roles that society needs.
* Why would you deliberately ignore what society needs to live your life in your own self indulgent bubble?
* Many students cite desired occupations as: 
    * Singer (X-Factor), Game Designer, Actor, Film Director, YouTuber, Steamer, Footballer.
    * Because that is the only world they know.
* This narrow view is understandable; it's ultimately the failing of adults ability to convey the concept of _society_ and _community_ to young people.
* We need to stop indulging our young people. We risk creating a generation that are self-obsessed and self-entitled and lack a wider perspective.

* [Spheres of influence: what shapes young people’s aspirations at age 12/13 and what are the implications for education policy?](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02680939.2013.790079) Louise Archer 2013
    * > We demonstrate how aspirations are shaped by structural forces (e.g. social class, gender and ethnicity) and how different spheres of influence (home/family, school, hobbies/leisure activities and TV) appear to shape different types of aspirations. The paper concludes by considering the implications for educational policy and careers education.

* Skill up to assist your community. (it may not be your passion, but being good at something is rewarding)
    * Get satisfaction from it.
    * Get recondition for it.
    * Get revenue for it.

Networking is critical

Use the extra financial capability to fund what you want to do. Be it travelling, starting a family, facilitating your own creative projects or adventures.
If they don't get a career and contribute back to society they are going to have problems.

    * Stop asking
        * If they have a boyfriend/girlfriend (they will tell you)
        * what their plans are
        * Are you sure that’s a lucrative career?
            * > Much like Millennials, we Gen Zers and are terrified of the instability of our futures caused by, well, you, kinda. We’ve inherited a dying planet, we’re already in mountains of debt thanks to the higher education we pretty much had to get, we will never own a home and, believe it or not, we often wonder if we can have a job we enjoy and also be able to regularly afford groceries. This question isn’t new to us. So while hearing it will certainly make our stomachs drop, it’ll also just straight-up piss us off, and we will 100% “ok boomer” your ass (behind your back, to our cousins). 
    * Stop giving them advice about a future you know nothing about

* [Job Interest Not a Big Predictor of Job Satisfaction](https://uh.edu/news-events/stories/2020/november-2020/11112020-kevin-hoff-interest-job-satisfaction.php)
    * > To be satisfied with a job, you don’t have to worry too much about finding a perfect fit for your interests because we know other things matter, too. As long as it’s something you don’t hate doing, you may find yourself very satisfied if you have a good supervisor, like your co-workers, and are treated fairly by your organization.
    * > Being interested in your work seems more important for job performance and the downstream consequences of performing well, like raises or promotions.
    * > In popular career guidance literature, it is widely assumed that interest fit is important for job satisfaction. Our results show that people who are more interested in their jobs tend to be slightly more satisfied, but interest assessments are more useful for guiding people towards jobs in which they will perform better and make more money.
