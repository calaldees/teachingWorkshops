Subject Pedagogy Sessions
-------------------------

4 days a week in school (subject mentor) + 1 Day a week in university (subject tutor)

* Subject Pedagogy: _How_ to teach Computing
    * > the method and practice of teaching, especially as an academic subject or theoretical concept
    * We will not give you
        * Resources to teach with (no lesson plans, no mark schemes)
* Reflective Practice
    * Once you have completed an activity, ask yourself the magical question: So what ...
        * what you have learned,
        * what do you now know more about
        * and how might that learning go on to influence your own future practice in the classroom?
    * You will make mistakes (continuously)
        * What matters is that everything is an opportunity to learn/grow

Course curriculum: Framed as a series of ten questions to develop your deepening understanding of learning and teaching practice over the year
1. Who are we?
2. How do we learn to teach?
3. What is a teacher?
4. What is education?
5. How do children learn?
6. What does ‘inclusion’ really mean?
7. How do you plan and assess for learning?
8. What is a broad and balanced curriculum?
9. How do I lead learning?
10. What is my impact?

Partnership schools and mentors will be using the same questions with you at the same time, to ensure joined up support between your placements and university teaching.


Support
-------

No Teacher is an island - You wont make this journey alone

* You wont have a frame of reference for what 'normal' looks like.
* You wont know what support you are entitled to, or what support you might me lacking.
* Multiple people will be looking out for your and supporting your first teaching steps.


* University (as a whole)
* Subject Tutor
    * Professional Academic Tutor (PAT) - that's me!
* Subject Mentor (school)
    * Multiple mentor visits from subject tutor
* Professional Mentor (school)
* Peers


* Pre-course [Padlet](https://cccu.padlet.org/allancallaghan/sz340htxrake670t)
    * Some of the other groups have setup a Padlet

* Types of trainees (A wide spectrum)
    * Your _First Professional Role_ (A huge change)
        * Moving on from the student/university mindset
        * What is the expected behaviour of a profession?
    * _Expert Beginner_ (A huge change)
        * You are an accomplished expert and respected in a particular field
        * Teaching is a different fields
        * Changing your role/status is hard and unsettling
            * Age? You may have a mentor younger than you
* Identified formal support process (you, tutor, mentor can raise at any time)
    * Targetted support plan
    * Identified concern plan


Professionalism
---------------

Mindset

* Postgraduate Study
    * You are in the drivers seat
    * There is no right/wrong mark
        * some students have the misconception of wanting their folder to be marked
    * No linear path (no spoon feed)
    * Your Portfolio is for you - You develop you
    * You drive mentor meetings
* You ARE a professional
    * If asked to teach a lesson on html - you are capable - you do - you ask for guidance if needed.
* Everyone on your course does not have to be "Your friend" - you are all at differnt points in your lives with differnt attitudes and interests - you don't have to _like_ your colleagues or classmates - you do need to collaborate and communicate professionally (as a requirement of the course - see targeted support plan)

* Professional identity
    * [The personal and professional selves of teachers: stable and unstable identities](https://www2.uwe.ac.uk/services/Marketing/students/NewStudents%202017%20onwards/PGCE%20Secondary%20reading%20-%20personal%20and%20professional%20selves.pdf) (C.Day et al 2005)


What schooling might look like next year?
-----------------------------------------

* How do we deliver a course _remotely_ or with limited contact?
    * Plan to have face to face university sessions - but that could change

Education is has been disrupted due to covid ...
* The idea of dedicated teacher classrooms or even subject areas are a thing of the past
* No text books
* No hand-outs
* Only teaching from the front
* Staggered lunches and break
* Staggered departure times
* Students in the same classrooms all day and year
* Group-specific areas of the school for lessons and breaks/lunches
* Only examine a random sample and rely on teacher moderation
    * [GCSE reform: a modest proposal](https://learningspy.co.uk/assessment/gcse-reform-a-modest-proposal/) David Didau

This could be for the next academic year and possibly longer.


What can you prepare
--------------------

* Take some time out for yourself and your loved ones this summer
* Consider your level of personal organisation
* Identify/prepare a work space at home
* Design a household routine to support you
* Consider how you will come across as a professional from day 1
    * From this day forth - your are a professional educator


Questions
---------

What I can tell you:
* You will be successful if you follow all the advice given next year
* You will be well supported
* You will find a great sense of achievement over the year
* It will be _hard_ work
* The year will change you!

What I can’t tell you:
* Where your placement school(s) will be (for PGCE students)
* What your school experience will “look like”


Summary
-------

I hope that at this stage this gives you the key information that you require to be able to prepare with confidence for the programme that lies ahead.
I will be in touch again over the summer with further information to ensure a smooth start for you in September.
However, should you wish to seek clarification on any element of the programme, then please do get back in contact with me and I will be happy to do my best to assist.

I look forward to seeing you in September.


Dates
-----
* 22nd September Induction day
* 24th September Subject Pedagogy Day One


IMPORTANT ACTIONS
=================

Don’t forget to register and formally join the course – please keep an eye on emails for further updates on dates and timings.

Please note that as part of the enrolment procedure to the programme it is essential that all students undertake the following three activities prior to the start of the programme.

1. You must be able to show, in person, your original certificates (or official evidence) of your GCSE in English and Maths, as well as the original certificate confirming your degree. You will need to do this at the Registration event in early September 2020.
2. You must also complete successful Occupational Health clearance (PGCE and non-salaried School Direct only)
3. You must also attain clearance through the DBS process (PGCE and non- salaried School Direct only)

Please note that you are responsible for initiating both the Occupational Health Check and the DBS clearance.

It is important that you are aware now that any student who has not passed through all three checks by the end of registration day in early September 2021 will not be able to start the programme.
Your place is in jeopardy unless you achieve all three actions above by that date.

## Learning Support Plan (LSP)

You will be assessed/supported with any additional learning needs. 
This is not automatic. You need to apply for this.

Pre-Course Activities
=====================

Dear Colleague,

Congratulations on being offered and having accepted a place to start on the PGCE/School Direct Computing programme in September.
Both programmes are very intensive and demanding, but are also a very enjoyable, stimulating and creative.
The more you can do before starting the programme, the easier it will be, especially in the first few weeks in September.

You may already have received some recommendations for action as part of your offer for your place.
The following points will support you in using the time from now until the start of the programme to full effect.

Please note this list is not a prescriptive list of what you must engage with before the course starts.
Rather, it is a list of activities that you might want to dip into to support your preparation for September.
You can do as much or as little from it as you like; I will not be judging you for it! After all, in the year ahead, you are not working for me, but for yourselves!

If you do engage with the activities, then you might want to collate some reflections about what you have learned from the reading/videos/apps
but, again, this is not a requirement.
It would however help you get into the habit of undertaking professional reflection which will be key to your success next year.

Your Computing Skills
---------------------

* As the course concentrates on teaching pedagogies, rather than spending time on improving your computing skills, you should take the opportunity ‘brush up’ your subject knowledge.
    * Once the course starts your time will be significantly limited
* You've all done a subject knowledge audit with your application. This document will be reworked before September. We will track your subject knowledge development.

Suggested activities

* Complete a GCSE Paper
    * [AQA GCSE Computer Science](https://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/computer-science-and-it/gcse/computer-science-8520)
        * Do Paper 1 + Paper 2 (from a cold start)
        * Mark your answers with the mark scheme
        * [Paper 1: Specimen question paper](https://filestore.aqa.org.uk/resources/computing/AQA-85201-SQP.PDF)

Equipment
---------

Will you need a personal laptop?

You will be put in a range of different environments at short notice.
* You may be mandated to use a school machine.
* You me be required to provide your own machine.
You should probably have a personal machine of some form ready-to-use in your back pocket.

Spec wise ... you will not need anything special.

Operating system should not matter to a Computing specialist. Use whatever you need to do the job you need.
E.g
* You could use Linux and use a VM or WINE for some Windows applications.
* You could use Windows and use Docker or WSL when you need nix based stuff
* Use OSx (again visualising when you need to)

Few thoughts
* Your placement school will have limited resources
* A provided laptop will have a 'spin-up time' as you figure out how it is setup or perform your required setup yourself
* As a computer scientist you will need the ability to self manage your machine and install whatever crazy stuff you need. (A provided laptop may not have these rights)
* Every school is different
* Your personal device may not be covered by your insurance or the schools insurance
* Your personal device may not even be allowed to connect to a school network


Additional Resources
--------------------

* The experimental school classroom: Professor Dylan Wiliam
    * In this two-part series, theory and practice meet head on as education expert Professor Dylan Wiliam sets up an experimental school classroom.
    * For one term, he takes over a Year 8 class at a secondary comprehensive to test simple ideas that he believes could improve the quality of our children's education.
    * Some of the higher ability students are not responding well to the new rule of No Hands Up in class, and Wiliam is worried they are at risk of being left behind.
    * There is a classroom revolt when the teachers remove grades from work.
    * The idea is to make the students actually read the comments on their work in order to help them improve, but they are left confused and angry after becoming so used to the traditional grading system.
    * By the end of term, however, even Wiliam is surprised by the impact the experiment has had on the students' academic achievement.
    * [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J25d9aC1GZA) 1 hour
