  * > Critical Theory is a social theory that aims to critique and change society as a whole. 
  * > Critical theories attempt to find the underlying assumptions in social life that keep people from fully and truly understanding how the world works.
  * > These underlying assumptions, in the view of critical theories, create a “False consciousness” that actively undermines people’s progress toward a true democracy.
