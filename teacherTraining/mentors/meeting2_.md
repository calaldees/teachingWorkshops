--- Network Meeting - Thursday 13th January
 
We will be hosting our second on-line gathering of subject mentors this week.
Computing 'Teacher Educator' Network Meeting - Thursday 13th January 2022 16.30 - 18:00
https://eu.bbcollab.com/guest/2729e6a602f445d0a232c6d45697e932

The purpose and impact of these meetings is:
To share and develop the subject (and curriculum) expertise of all Teacher Educators,
and therefore enrich the dialogue and support in the Student Progress Review Triads, the placement setting activity and the ITTE Curriculum, as there will be a greater coherence between the placements and university.

In this second meeting we will focus on Key Spotlight Questions 6 & 7:
 - KSQ6: "What does inclusion really mean?"
 - KSQ7: "How do you plan and assess learning?"

The purpose of this meeting is not 'training'.
It is an opportunity for us as 'Teacher Educators' to discuss the points below.
Please come prepared to share some of your views on:
 - How might we support Neurodiversity in Teacher education?
 - What does an inclusive subject classroom look like?
 - How do we support our student teachers to plan and assess learning?
   - Joint planning? Observation feedback?
 - What does learning look like for student teachers?
 - What are the barriers to student teachers?
 - How might you remove them?

There will also be time to discuss any interesting literature that you have been reading and to address any questions you have about particular student issues.

My Notes
--------

<details>
<summary>My notes/examples for discussion points</summary>

### Dyslexic
* Spelt "Simpsons" incorrectly in front of bottom set Year 7.
* Slow reader - spend additional time
* Reasonable orator and technologist

### Slightly autistic friend - English teacher
Ongoing challenge voiced - always has to oppose something
Can't interpret awkward social situations - will just keep pushing
One way - wont reciprocate mutual understanding


### Possible high functioning asperger trainee
* Agitated by 'functionless' pleasantry's in emails
* repeatedly sending clarification question emails
    * especially dates and times
* Lack of eye contact, constant fidgeting, tapping, spinning pens when in serious conversation
* High tension socially (distanced from peers)
    * added to my communication overhead
* Verbal and remote - constant list of things we have failed to provide to help/support/inform (these were false claims as all other trainees appear to has acted/responded correctly)


### Schools response to student with LSP
School - see LSP Anexiety - reject placement (humm) - to many needs for us to cater for


### Overall questions
If trainees are unable to interpret the social cues of students - are they capable of performing the role?
Would you give them this opportunity?
How much support can we realistically give?
When is this "too much" support?
