Mentor Gathering 2
==================

1. Announcements + What this session is (10min)
2. Spotlight discussion - Inclusion (45min)
3. Future Network Meetings (5min)


Announcements
-------------

* SPR2 will be simplified - thank you for being part of the process and feedback
* Absence due to covid should be impactful in trainees completing the course
* Upcoming student teacher assignment
    * Professional Presentation - How bundle relates to 'policy'


This Session
------------

* Not 'training' - this is a professional knowledge exchange.
    * Discuss the process of mentoring with other mentors
    * My role
        * As a tutor at university; I am not a mentor in schools. I don't have any elevated insight, skills, knowledge or powers to tell you how to mentor.
        * I can offer another perspective
* Time?! Why?
    * What's the assessment criteria - compulsory?
    * Trim unnecessary burdens from your schedule to simply survive (... I hear you!)



Institution wording:
> The purpose and impact of these meetings is:
> To share and develop the subject (and curriculum) expertise of all Teacher Educators,
> and therefore enrich the dialogue and support in the Student Progress Review Triads, the placement setting activity and the ITTE Curriculum, as there will be a greater coherence between the placements and university.


Teacher Educators - The near future
-----------------

* Mentors involved in 2 year ECF (formerly NQT year)
    * 30 hours development (citation needed)
        * How are schools going to facilitate this?
* Theory reading/studies/evidence is a key driver underpinning the ECF (and the teaching profession in general)
    * A very good direction! however ... when do we get the time to engage in this?
* (Currently) fragmented terminology for these meetings
    * Mentor Gathering
    * Teacher Educator Network Meeting

* Reading suggested from [ITT Core Content Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-itt-core-content-framework) (CCF)
    * [What informs mentors' practice when working with trainees and newly qualified teachers? An investigation into mentors' professional knowledge base](../__CCF-reading-summary.md#mentor-knowledge) 2007 Jones M, Straker K
        * > we need to enable mentors to free themselves from the idiosyncratic practices they may have developed over the years by providing access to adequate training and developmental programmes


Spotlight Discussion - Supporting our student teachers - Planning for Inclusion
--------------------

In this second meeting we will focus on Key Spotlight Questions 6 & 7:
 - KSQ6: "What does inclusion really mean?"
 - KSQ7: "How do you plan and assess learning?"

The purpose of this meeting is not 'training'.
It is an opportunity for us as 'Teacher Educators' to discuss the points below.
Please come prepared to share some of your views on:
* How might we support Neurodiversity in Teacher education?
* What does an inclusive subject classroom look like?
* How do we support our student teachers to plan and assess learning?
    * Joint planning? Observation feedback?
    * Questions?
* What does learning look like for student teachers?
    * What are the barriers to student teachers?
    * How might you remove them?

Two perspectives
1. Our inclusion of diversity with our student teachers
2. Guiding our student teachers with planning for inclusion

There will also be time to discuss any interesting literature that you have been reading and to address any questions you have about particular student issues.

Some of my Reading
------------------

* [What are the views and experiences of autistic teachers? Findings from an online survey in the UK](https://doi.org/10.1080/09687599.2021.1916888) Wood, Happe, 2021
    * There is a lack of research into autistic teachers and other autistic school staff.
    * Autistic school staff experience many difficulties in training, recruitment, job satisfaction and career development.
* [Neurodiversity in the Classroom](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1f91/fe220ea1ac004a9c4c342a1fa69819917359.pdf) Armstrong 
    * Strength-Based Strategies to Help Students With Special Needs Succeed
    * Lists categories of strengths
* [Neurodiversity awareness: Is Malaysia there yet?](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1238367.pdf) Woolard, Rahman, Aida 2019
* [Two Comments on "Neurodiversity"](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/25793/25472270.pdf) 2008
    * > challenging teachers to change pedagogy, rather than simply assisting students to conform.
    * > it does mean that the meanings and values attributed to the disabled are enacted by cultures, not nature.
* [From 'Disordered' to 'Diverse': Defining Six Sociological Frameworks Employed in the Study of Dyslexia in the UK](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1218476) Macdonald 2019
    * (1) the biomedical, (2) the biopsychosocial, (3) the social model, (4) the critical realist, (5) the post-structuralistic, and (6) the neurodivergent approach


* Different models of disability
    * Disablism (stereotypes of disabled people)
    * Medical model -> the person needs to change/adapt -> anxious, wheelchair, lazy
        * > Underlying the medical model is the belief that the difficulties associated with a disability should be borne wholly by the disabled person, 
          > and that the disabled person should make an extra effort (perhaps in time, effort, money, etc.) to ensure they do not inconvenience anyone else. 
          > They must change and adapt to fit the circumstances and their environment such as attending university.
    * Social model of disability -> the person needs support -> low-income, negative attitudes, badly designed buildings
    * > your responsibility to ensure that your learning and teaching activities and materials are accessible.


My Notes
--------

<details>
<summary>My notes/examples for discussion points</summary>

### Dyslexic
* Spelt "Simpsons" incorrectly in front of bottom set Year 7.
* Slow reader - spend additional time
* Reasonable orator and technologist

### Slightly autistic friend - English teacher
Ongoing challenge voiced - always has to oppose something
Can't interpret awkward social situations - will just keep pushing
One way - wont reciprocate mutual understanding


### Possible high functioning asperger trainee
* Agitated by 'functionless' pleasantry's in emails
* repeatedly sending clarification question emails
    * especially dates and times
* Lack of eye contact, constant fidgeting, tapping, spinning pens when in serious conversation
* High tension socially (distanced from peers)
    * added to my communication overhead
* Verbal and remote - constant list of things we have failed to provide to help/support/inform (these were false claims as all other trainees appear to has acted/responded correctly)


### Schools response to student with LSP
School - see LSP Anxiety - reject placement (humm) - to many needs for us to cater for


### Overall questions
If trainees are unable to interpret the social cues of students - are they capable of performing the role?
Would you give them this opportunity?
How much support can we realistically give?
When is this "too much" support?
