Computing - Mentor Meeting 1
============================

* Thursday 11th November 2021 

### Purpose
* Share and develop the subject (and curriculum) expertise of all Teacher Educators
    * (You are now categorised as a Teacher Educator!)
* Greater coherence between school and uni
* Strengthening our use of the ITTE Curriculum

### first meeting of Teacher Educators 
* explore the first three Key Spotlight Questions:
    * Who are we?
    * How do you learn to teach?
    * What is a teacher?
* (Just checking - aware of key spotlight questions?)

### Timings? (1 hour)

1. Intro (10min)
1. Student Progress Reviews (20min)
2. Visits (5min)
3. Build a network (breakout rooms) (15min)
4. What is a Teacher Educator? What is a Computing Teacher? (10min)
5. Closing and Next Steps (5min)

(Can we fit it all in?)

Visits
------

* Required to have one visit per placement
    * Face-to-face or virtual
* Mentor facing/focused
    * My role is to Support/QA your mentoring
    * (I can watch the student teach if needed)
* Could align with SPR1?


Build a network
---------------

* It would be valuable to build contacts with other mentors


What is a Teacher Educator?
---------------------------

* How can we as mentors and tutors develop our expertise?
    * Mentoring -> Coaching?
    * Theory/Scholarship


What is a Computing Teacher?
----------------------------

* What does it mean to be a teacher of Subject? 
* Do we all have a common understanding?
    * [Subject Knowledge Audit]

    * Conflicting approaches
        * "Thinking" (just the concept) or "Thinking and Making" (doing it in code)
        * > Transcribing to real code is not carried out by my students. [After writing the algorithm in pseudo-code], it does not add any value … at that time, they are at the level of understanding where they should be
        * > I want my students to be able to specify a logical solution for a problem on the level of elementary building blocks so you can make a one-on-one translation to a programming language
        * > Students will make something so they really get an idea what it involves rather than remaining theoretical

    *  > the beginning of the process, artifacts of students guided by instructivist teachers were found to be higher in their programming level quality, compared to the products of students guided by constructivist teachers.
    *  > students who learn by constructivist guidance and over time gain experience in visual programming, close the gap with students learning under instructivist guidance in their ability to create an artifact at a good programming level. It can be assumed that ongoing constructivist guidance emphasizing active learning, encourages students to choose high standards for their projects
    *  > (constructivist) ... will ultimately lead students to overall and broader success in the learning process, although this does require additional time.
    *  > After six months of experience under constructivist guidance, students were able to program with a base of wider personal knowledge and experience


Closing and Next Steps
----------------------

* 3rd year computer science undergrads wanting and understanding of school teaching before embarking on PGCE application?
    * Try before you buy?
* Assistance with Interviewing PGCE candidates
    * Bagsi them?
* The next Session 
    * Thursday 13th January 2022 - 16.30 – 17:30
