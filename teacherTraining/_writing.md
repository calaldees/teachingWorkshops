> Provide specific examples to support claims, retaining an evaluative rather than emotive stance. Avoid hyperbole such as ‘incredibly creative’ unless you can provide specific evidence to support the statement.

> Unpick the references you draw on to make them fully work for your developing argument.

One of the main tips I can give for research is find the names of the big players in an area and 
1.) Look at the other work they have done. It will probably be in a similar area.
2.) Follow their references. What previous research are they inspired by and building on.
3.) Some online services show links/references to papers that reference the one you are reading. This is great to help you find more recent sources that build on a seminal paper/topic.

Content
Identify relevant issues that justify your choice of research. Refer to current literature, research and policy (search for ‘critique of…’ to check any key theories are relevant that underpin your study).
Explain theoretical concepts and key terms, for example terms such as growth mindset, Maths mastery, executive functions, inclusion.  Similarly explain school-specific jargon – for instance not all schools talk about “red warnings”, or “green for go”.
Check that your abstract includes introduction, purpose, methodology, findings, conclusion.


Reading
Avoid description of readings and deploy critique.   Avoid anecdote and ensure own views are balanced with those of others.  Try to take a more nuanced view of the reading, rather than a polarised view (e.g. one which is either firmly approve or firmly disapprove). Look for shades of grey.
Compare and contrast the views of different authors, and look for opposing or dissenting views to contrast. Synthesise viewpoints. 
Consider your use of author prominent/information prominent referencing.  Is it clear to the reader how you are using the reading as supporting evidence for your argument?
Engage critically with the reading, not taking the authors’ views as givens or as statements of fact but assessing the quality of the evidence they provide.  Show awareness of the extent and relevance of any research (e.g. research in primary schools, longitudinal study, meta-analysis).
Choose a wider range of literature to provide a more balanced and nuanced range of opinions.

Methodology
Show understanding of the paradigm you are researching within (interpretative/autoethnographic/action research etc).
Explain the choice of methodology, identifying strengths and limitations of the method and how you have compensated for these (e.g. by triangulation). Refer to literature to justify your choices.
Be clear about your method for analysing your data.  Justify your choice of thematic analysis/use of a framework for analysis.  Explain any coding systems.
Mention explicitly the importance of anonymity for the school and pupils.
Refer explicitly to ethical issues pertaining to your study, mentioning why they are important.  Refer to BERA guidelines and/or other ethical literature (e.g. linking to ethical discussions in similar research studies).

Evidence/ use of data
Avoid anecdotes of practice and instead refer directly to examples.
Reference them deliberately and explicitly e.g. “This first guided reading dialogue is an example of what xxxxx (2019) refer to as …”; “student B in extract 2 is exhibiting the xxxxxx analysed by xxxxx (2005). This is clearly shown by his use of the phrase….”
You can refer to descriptive evidence in the appendix so you only need to provide brief descriptive coding in the body. Use your data analytically, not descriptively.   Be clear about the difference between results (what you found) and your discussion of the results (your analysis).  The discussion is a key element of your report.
Make connections between your data analysis and your reading.

Organisation
Reference correctly, in particular: include the date of publication; omit author’s first name; reference web pages correctly; include page numbers for quotations; organise the reference list in alphabetical order; include in the reference list all readings mentioned in the text.  Use Cite them Right (in library search to make sure that you are referencing correctly)
Avoid broad generalisations or sweeping statements that could be challenged (check your use of information prominent reference – does this suggest a generalisation?).  Such statements are often presented as fact - they need a critique.  Try to support all statements with references to literature or practice.  Try to balance your own views against those of others
Avoid rhetorical questions which imply the acceptance of a particular view.  It is ok though to present your research questions and then systematically address them.
Check for unnecessary repetition of ideas, phrases, words (tautology).
Signpost the reader through the text – where are you going and what is the direction of travel?  Careful choice of subheadings can help to tell your research story. Try to use one substantial idea per paragraph.  The formula PEEL for each paragraph may help:
P – Your Point
E – An explanation of this point
E – Evidence from practice or reading (synthesise viewpoints).
L – Link to the next paragraph and the next idea                                                        
Avoid bullet points and lists as they tend to be descriptive rather than analytical (except where organising points you are making in bullet points is helpful for the reader).  
Avoid quoting at great length and aim to paraphrase wherever possible.  Also avoid ‘freestanding’ quotes (which seem to form a paragraph of their own) which have no explanation of relevance to a key point .
Ensure all material is relevant to the title (you may need to change your title to make sure it clearly signposts the research story to the reader).  

Other
Ensure that the work is spellchecked and properly proofread.  This includes checking for spellings, punctuation and choice of words which can make the essay very hard to read
Ensure that acronyms are explained at first use.  Avoid colloquialisms – “you might teach …”; “doesn’t”.  
Read the assignment brief carefully and develop all sections of this carefully.  
Check for commonly confused words such as affect/effect; practice/practise
Check apostrophes! Do not use contractions (don’t).
Block indent any quote over 3 lines (but think carefully about whether you should paraphrase the quote or be more selective about the quote)
If you include images, graphs or illustrations, provide a caption.  Refer to tables as table 1, table 2,  and images as fig. 3 etc  Include a list of tables and figs in your contents page. 
Make sure you spell authors’ names accurately – “Dylan Wiliam” and “Janet Tod” examples of names that are frequently misspelled (these are correct here)
Write a strong conclusion which sums up the key implications from your research – however, avoid tautology (do not just repeat what you have said before).  This should link to your abstract.
Write a strong introduction which gives a rationale for the choice of research (this should link to your abstract)
Include a word count at the end of the essay (not including abstract, contents page, reference list or appendices)
Use box for inserting(on Blackboard – Assessments) sign the ethical clearance (this can be done electronically).  Choose targets that you have been working on from your previous feedback.  Include your research proposal in the appendix and one example of the wording for consent letters, questionnaires, interview questions, assent scripts etc.
