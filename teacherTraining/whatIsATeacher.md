    * > The second hardest thing I did in my teaching career was realizing that the teachers I liked might not have been great for others. The hardest was realizing that the way I liked to teach might not be the most effective for all students.

Criicality

* Blended learning
    * Traditional: All learning done in the same classroom with the same teacher
    * Blended: The deliberate planning for different methods of delivery
        * Async/Synchronous 
        * Rotating, rooms, labs, equipment, teachers
* Flipped learning
    * Traditional: Lower order knowledge skills in lessons. Higher order skills (like evaluating) done at home
    * Flipped: Lower order knowledge skills at home (async). Higher order evaluation/discussion (sync) in class

> The problem is that both versions present a false vision of learning. 
> Learning is not a hierarchy or a linear process. 
> This graphic gives the mistaken impression that these cognitive processes are discrete, that it's possible to perform one of these skills separately from others. 
> It also gives the mistaken impression that some of these skills are more difficult





TODO:




What is a Computer Science teacher?
-----------------------------------

TASK 1: What is the difference between _Computing_ and _Computer Science_

TASK 2:
* What are the students expectations?
* What are societies expectations?
* What are your expectations of you (as a Computer Science teacher)?

https://cccu.padlet.org/allancallaghan/jqu3zev2hohi3mm8


### My thoughts

* Teacher identity
    * your belief changes the curriculum
        * Mathematical (logic)
        * Scientific (experimentation)
        * engineering (outcome/construction)
        * Ways of thinking/mindsets
* Computing and society (human/computer hybrid society)

* Intersection of many intellectual traditions
    * Difficult history
        * Maths? (Logic, Set Theory) Statistics? Science? Theory of Computation?
    * Computer scientists late to the party in many areas


### Average Computing knowledge and skills

We need to tackle this misconception between what the average person thinks of Computing and what the academic discipline is.

Society bundles Computer Science, ICT, Digital Literacy into the same pot.

TODO: https://www.manchesterdigital.com/talent-and-skills/digital-skills-audit

* Some year 7's have never used a keyboard
    * Logging on is a lesson (tears/frustration)
* Don't know how to turn a computer on


### Recent influences in Computing teaching

Demands of modern-society.
Modern-computing compared with classical-computing.

TASK: What do we mean 
* Classical-computing?
* Modern-computing?

Traditional mathematical components of computing - theoretical underpinning
* Logic, NAND gates, binary number representation, algorithm design, algorithm complexity, processor architecture

The modern reality and use of computers as seen by society is very different. These feel like secondary order effects of computing
* Single board computers, Voice UI, AI/Behaviour/DataScience, BioInfomatics


What is Computer Science specific pedagogy?
-------------------------------------------

_subject pedagogy_ is the _how do we teach computing_

TASK: How might teaching Computer Science be different from teaching other subjects?

(Refer to Constructivism on Friday)

### Stuff

* Threshold concepts and Liminal Space
* Transfer of knowledge across contexts dose not happen automatically
* We are less familiar with early experiences that may lead to computing skills

### Computational thinking
Systems Thinking
Autonomous Organisations
Business Process
(hybrid society)

* Computational Thinking
    * logical thinking
    * algorithms
    * patters (recondition)
    * abstraction (generalisation)
    * evaluation
    * automation
* Computational Practices
    * Problem decomposition
    * Creating computing artifacts
    * Testing/debugging
    * Iterative refinement
    * Collaboration & creativity

### Mindset
* Growth mindset
* Encouraged to find new strategies
* Importance of making good use of high quality feedback


### Programming
Cant build instructions, because they don't know the building blocks
* use + modify + create

Block (visual) -> text

Text is actually hard to visual identify relationships

### Misconceptions
* THEN implies sequence
* Natural language dose not have looping (exit case), passing parameters




Induction Snippets
------------------

Spaced repetition: These are such important concepts I want to touch on them, even though you will cover them later in induction.



### Your development phases

* Unconscious incompetence
* Concious incompetence
* Concious competence
* Unconscious competence





### Cognitive Bias

> "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself â€“ and you are the easiest person to fool." - Richard Feynman

You have bias's because you are a human.
As humans We must be aware of our bias's

TASK 1: Brainstorm all the bias's you can think of

TASK 2: Compare your list to these lists

Action point: I recommend you refer/remind yourself of these bias's regularly.

Previously the hot topic was _Pupil Impact_. It was all about impact, impact, impact, impact, impact!

The new hot topic is apparently _Research_.

* Action points?
* Reflection?

> learning to teach is a decision-making process that demands the constant reinvention of practice so as to responsively meet needs presented by ever-changing contexts and diverse learners.

    * > growing criticism about the utility of teacher education (Goldhaber and Brewer 2000; Goodwin and Oyler 2008; Walsh 2001), particularly preparation that is university based
    * > teacher educators ... referred to them as the â€˜missing linkâ€™ in education.
    * > Not surprisingly, while professional standards for teachers are quite evident and plentiful, standards for teacher educators remain nascent
    * > more long-lasting benefit comes from the ability to study a situation, notice what students need, and invent appropriate practices (Schoonmaker 2002), 
    * > (teacher education is) preparing teachers to remake the profession,
    * > teacher educators need formal preparation and induction
