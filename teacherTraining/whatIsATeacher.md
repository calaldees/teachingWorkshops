What is a Computer Science teacher?
-----------------------------------

TASK 1: What is the difference between _Computing_ and _Computer Science_

TASK 2:
* What are the students expectations?
* What are societies expectations?
* What are your expectations of you (as a Computer Science teacher)?

https://cccu.padlet.org/allancallaghan/jqu3zev2hohi3mm8


### My thoughts

* Teacher identity
    * your belief changes the curriculum
        * Mathematical (logic)
        * Scientific (experimentation)
        * engineering (outcome/construction)
        * Ways of thinking/mindsets
* Computing and society (human/computer hybrid society)

* Intersection of many intellectual traditions
    * Difficult history
        * Maths? (Logic, Set Theory) Statistics? Science? Theory of Computation?
    * Computer scientists late to the party in many areas


### Average Computing knowledge and skills

We need to tackle this misconception between what the average person thinks of Computing and what the academic discipline is.

Society bundles Computer Science, ICT, Digital Literacy into the same pot.

[The Distribution of Users’ Computer Skills: Worse Than You Think](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/computer-skill-levels/)

TODO: https://www.manchesterdigital.com/talent-and-skills/digital-skills-audit

* Some year 7's have never used a keyboard
    * Logging on is a lesson (tears/frustration)
* Don't know how to turn a computer on


### Recent influences in Computing teaching

Demands of modern-society.
Modern-computing compared with classical-computing.

TASK: What do we mean 
* Classical-computing?
* Modern-computing?

Traditional mathematical components of computing - theoretical underpinning
* Logic, NAND gates, binary number representation, algorithm design, algorithm complexity, processor architecture

The modern reality and use of computers as seen by society is very different. These feel like secondary order effects of computing
* Single board computers, Voice UI, AI/Behaviour/DataScience, BioInfomatics


What is Computer Science specific pedagogy?
-------------------------------------------

_subject pedagogy_ is the _how do we teach computing_

TASK: How might teaching Computer Science be different from teaching other subjects?

(Refer to Constructivism on Friday)

### Stuff

* Threshold concepts and Liminal Space
* Transfer of knowledge across contexts dose not happen automatically
* We are less familiar with early experiences that may lead to computing skills

### Computational thinking
Systems Thinking
Autonomous Organisations
Business Process
(hybrid society)

* Computational Thinking
    * logical thinking
    * algorithms
    * patters (recondition)
    * abstraction (generalisation)
    * evaluation
    * automation
* Computational Practices
    * Problem decomposition
    * Creating computing artifacts
    * Testing/debugging
    * Iterative refinement
    * Collaboration & creativity

### Mindset
* Growth mindset
* Encouraged to find new strategies
* Importance of making good use of high quality feedback


### Programming
Cant build instructions, because they don't know the building blocks
* use + modify + create

Block (visual) -> text

Text is actually hard to visual identify relationships

### Misconceptions
* THEN implies sequence
* Natural language dose not have looping (exit case), passing parameters




Induction Snippets
------------------

Spaced repetition: These are such important concepts I want to touch on them, even though you will cover them later in induction.

### Terminology

* [Ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science))
    * > formal naming and definition of the categories, properties and relations between the concepts
    * Ontological argument
        * Should number base's (base 2, binary) be in Mathematics rather than Computer Science?
        * Platypus? Mammal that lays eggs
* [Epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology)
    * The theory/nature of knowledge
        * arrived at independent of experience (e.g. through logic - rationalist, intuition - non-rational)
        * empirical (verifiable by observation), or arrived at through experience
* [Autoethnography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoethnography)
    * a form of qualitative research in which an author uses self-reflection and writing to explore anecdotal and personal experience and connect this autobiographical story to wider cultural, political, and social meanings and understandings
    * > autoethnographers are themselves the primary participant/subject of the research


### Cognitive Bias

> "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool." - Richard Feynman

You have bias's because you are a human.
As humans We must be aware of our bias's

TASK 1: Brainstorm all the bias's you can think of

TASK 2: Compare your list to these lists

Action point: I recommend you refer/remind yourself of these bias's regularly.

Subject Knowledge Audit

Subject Pedagogy (SP) Assignment
--------------------------------

WARNING: The Subject Pedagogy Assignment will be set formally soon.
This is a PREVIEW. There may be minor changes. (To my knowledge there are no major changes planned)
[Subject Pedagogy (SP) Assignment 2019/2020](https://cccu.padlet.org/sharron_mackenzie1/mhqf3wfen2yb)

Previously the hot topic was _Pupil Impact_. It was all about impact, impact, impact, impact, impact!

The new hot topic is apparently _Research_.
