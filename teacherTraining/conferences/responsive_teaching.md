Whiteboards - be very clear - the WHOLE class - 3,2,1

Multiple choice questions - tips
* Precice focus avoid complex vocabulary
* Not be negativly prased
* Alternatives should be similar in content, multually exclusive and not overlap
* incorrect answer should point to a misconception


Think-Pair-Share
Talk parteners in every seating plan

3,2,1 to start tasks
Wait time + thinking time
(Don't give questions without thinking time)

When SEN students are scared of answering - overhear them talking in the think-pair-share - praise them - let them know you will call upon them to say that to the class.
What did your partener say (did they listen)


Pre plan when you're going to ask the hinge questions (every 20 mins?)

Deliberate: 20 seconds thinking time

Ask the question first THEN say who will answer it

No Opt Out - "I don't know"
Right is Right - Don't settle for partially correct answers - build on it until you arrive on the right answer - return to the first answerer for the right answer
Right answer but at the wrong time - great, but not the right time. Uphold the standards
Stretch it - another way to answer (even the right answer is left with wonder that there is more)
