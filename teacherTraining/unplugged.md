Explore Unplugged Computer Science Activities (2 Hours)
----------------------------------------------

Async 1 hour 30 min + Group 30min == 2 hours

* Many aspects of computing can be taught without a computer.
* Watch the following trailer video
    * [Computer Science Unplugged trailer](https://youtu.be/KOYy4kyLEHs) 3min
* This adds an extra dimension of excitement and intrigue. Magic tricks can form discussion points. These physical activities are memorable and powerful.
* There are lots of resources out there. The trick is YOU knowing what's out their and digesting the activities so that you can run them.
    * As a group we can explore 10hours+ of reading/exploring and share it with the group

TASK:
* Goal: To have 3 activities that you could in the future run for a class with 0min notice.
    * e.g.
        * The network is down
        * There is a power cut
        * You are asked to cover another teachers lesson and no work has been set
        * You are asked to give a 1 hour workshop to a group of visiting primary students in the school hall
        * It's the last day of term and students are not particularly focused and want to do something different
    * Consider having the various printouts you would need to have ready _on standby_ in your classroom
        * I know in covid times some of these activities may not be appropriate, but it wont be this way forever!

1. (individual) Explore a range of CS Unplugged activities (1 hour 30 min) - consider 3 activities
    * Put links to the actives that you have settled on in Google Doc
2. (group) Describe one of the activities your explored to the group (30 min)
    * explain: 
        * what age/ability group it might be for?
        * what resources (props, printouts, space) you would need?
        * how much time?

Assembly Idea? - The power of code/automation
---------------------------------------------

* Each student given unique sudoku problem (batch generated by code)
* Explain the rules of sudoku
* I will write some code to solve sudoku - while the class/assembly solves the paper problems
* 30 Mortals vs 1 'Computer + Programmer' - play the _Mortal Kombat_ soundtrack
* [hackertyper.net](https://hackertyper.net/) - fun hacker stereotype simulator in a webbrowser - each keypress types 3 characters from a random linux source file
    * You can upload your own file
* Get the program to list and solve every problem that was given to the room (in realtime)
    * If you do A-Level computing, I will explain this code to you

With code: One person on the planet solve the problem 'once' and it's solved forever

> The pen is mightier than the sword.
> A computer may be mightier than the pen.

* If you could use a computer properly - if you could code ... 
* you could use it for incredible personal gain, maximise output, control information
* or 
* you could use it to empower people, grow community's, foster collaboration and share the expanded capabilities/solutions with humanity
* The choice is yours, but only if you know how to use the tool
* Otherwise ... you don't get a choice, you'll be solving somebody else's (possibly meaningless) sudokus
