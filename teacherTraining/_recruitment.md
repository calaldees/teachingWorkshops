    * What are the reality's of the teaching profession?

* How do you get into the teaching profession?

I will now take you on an emotional journey ... buckle up!


Reality of Teaching
-------------------

* It's not about _you_, it's about your students. They are different to you.
    * Quote from previous applicant: "Teach computing with games, everybody loves games" - this is not effective or inclusive
* You have a degree. You are already into the top % of the population. Many of the young people you teach will not be.
* Kent has one of the highest % of Grammar schools in the country (50%ish)
    * Some people say Kent has a real class divide
    * [Grammar schools and social mobility](https://epi.org.uk/publications-and-research/grammar-schools-social-mobility/) - School Performance, Admissions, & Capacity Report 2016
        *  > we find no overall attainment impact of grammar schools, either positive or negative
* You don't stop at 3pm each day and have holidays
* The job encroaches your home life
* There is no limit to the work you can do - you can always do more
* You must look after yourself and allocate time for other interests outside of your job

### A day in the life of a teacher

(I'm kind of going to exaggerate this, but the principles are true)

* You have to deliver 5 hours of tour-de-force lessons each day
    * Starter task, summary ending task
    * Differentiated resources to stretch the higher achieving and support the weaker ones
    * You need to be expert in:
        * low ability illiterate (11 year old's) - though to - 1st year undergrad level (18 year old's)
        * Skilled in Special educational needs prevision - Behavioural difficulties - ADHD - Autism
        * English as an additional language
* Break up a fight a lunch or have to console a crying child from bullying at lunch (no lunch break for you)
* 6 hour minimum on your feet, projecting your voice, constantly alert, constantly supervising and in control (Emotionally and physically demanding)
* At 3pm it's time for
    * Parents evening
    * After-school club (expected to do this)
    * Detentions
    * After-school support for the students that are behind
    * Further professional development training
* You get home at 6pm (exhausted)... now it's time for ...
    * Planning 5 hours of tour-de-force lessons for tomorrow
    * Mark every single piece of work with feedback for every single one of the 130 students you taught today
    * And washing, cooking, maintaining yourself and interacting with the other people in your life
* Holidays?
    * Your _holidays_ will be franticly trying to catchup with planning and marking
    * And because you have scheduled holidays - you can't take days off during term time - unless it's a hospital appointment or death in the family
    * If you don't have good health and have sick days, you'll create masses of catchup work for you, your students will be disadvantaged (every second counts for the exam) and you would significantly overburden your colleges

Teaching is hard.

You need to be:
* Physically fit
* Emotionally stable
* Highly skilled


Woh! .. um ... So Why Teach?
----------------------------

Because 
* It's a meaningful job.
* You have a respected professional identity in society.
* Interacting with other human beings has a sense of purpose like no other.

Let's contrast this against ...

### A day in the life of a software developer

(I'm kind of going to exaggerate this, but the principles are true)

* You work really hard and expertly with a team of developers to provide solutions for an organisation
* Organisations run on money. Your metrics are based on your business worth
* Sit in-front of a screen, all day, every day in a windowless air conditioned office, 9 till 5, until you are 68 years old with a total of 20 days holiday per year freedom.
* You will interact with the same handful of people every day (hope you like them)
* Your grand accomplishment (could be) raising _advert revenue_ for your company
* You have to constantly upskill yourself in the latest tech as the required skills in industry move VERY quickly. Keep up or get off the horse.
* You will be paid more than most other professions you could probably do, but with that comes expectation to _perform_


... So Why Teach?
-----------------

* You could be a great cog in a money making machine, you could be a good _brain at a keyboard_.
* When you are a teacher, _who you are_ matters.
    * I don't just teach computing. How I conduct myself as role model has an impact on others.


(Side note: in both professions: Your _passion_ can be manipulated and exploited)

Overall
-------

* You have never worked this hard in your life (seriously!)
* This year will change you
* This profession will change you
* It will become part of your identity
* Don't decide to train to teach because there is a bursary and it's more of _being a student_ or you _couldn't think of anything else to do_


* I love tech - I love coding ... 
* ... but I feel alive when teaching


Money
-----

* As a career - You will be underpaid for the hours you do - don't do this job for the money
* but ... 
* £24,000 Tax Free Bursary (£2000 a month for free directly into your bank account) + tax free additional loan to cover tuition fees (£9000-ish)
    * Make no mistake - this is a bribe to get you into the profession - Once you're in, you will likely work in this field for many years
    * (Pay your national insurance manually for your PGCE year!!)

* The experimental school classroom: Professor Dylan Wiliam
    * In this two-part series, theory and practice meet head on as education expert Professor Dylan Wiliam sets up an experimental school classroom.
    * For one term, he takes over a Year 8 class at a secondary comprehensive to test simple ideas that he believes could improve the quality of our children's education.
    * Some of the higher ability students are not responding well to the new rule of No Hands Up in class, and Wiliam is worried they are at risk of being left behind.
    * There is a classroom revolt when the teachers remove grades from work.
    * The idea is to make the students actually read the comments on their work in order to help them improve, but they are left confused and angry after becoming so used to the traditional grading system.
    * By the end of term, however, even Wiliam is surprised by the impact the experiment has had on the students' academic achievement.

    * Feedback
        * > In college, feedback is clear and consistent. You have a syllabus, which details the requirements for the semester and the standards upon which you’ll be graded.
        * > the feedback you receive at work is often less consistent and less easily decipherable than in college
    * Relationships
    * Accountability
* [The dispassionate developer](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2021/03/22/the-dispassionate-developer/) by Mark Seemann - Caring for your craft is fine, but should you work for free?
    * Companies wont train you, they expect you to work for free (on open source projects)
    * Passion can be manipulated and exploited
        * > My point with this article isn't that there's anything wrong with being passionate about software development. The point is that you might want to regard it as a weakness rather than an asset. If you are passionate, beware that someone doesn't take advantage of you. 
    *  > What happens if you don't keep up to date with new methodologies, new frameworks, new programming languages? Your skill set becomes obsolete. Not overnight, but over the years. Finding a new job becomes harder and harder.
       >
       > As your marketability atrophies, your employer can treat you worse and worse. After all, where are you going to go?
       > 
       > As disappointing as it may be, keeping up to date with technology is your responsibility, and if you can't sneak in some time for self-improvement at work, you'll have to do it on your own time.
       > 
       > This has little to do with passion, but much to do with self-preservation. 
    * > I do know an effective trick: get him or her to hire me (or another expensive consultant). Most people don't heed advice given for free, but if they pay dearly for it, they tend to pay attention.
