Literacy, Numeracy and Citizenship
==================================

What is a broad and balanced curriculum?

* _Broad and balanced_ curriculum, not teaching to the test/exam
* Ofsted criteria for schools
    * revisiting the Education inspection framework in context of wider curriculum
* Careers Guidance in the area of computing
* Revisit literacy, numeracy, digital-literacy in Computing

Next week
* Personal and Professional Development Day 12th March 2021
* The Hidden Curriculum, Mental health and Well-being.

Session Format
--------------

* Many of the activities today will be discussion and group based
* We will split into two groups and at milestone points each group will share their ideas
* I have created two GoogleDoc Workspaces
    * [PGCE/SD Computing SP16 - Group1 - Workspace](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kaJpm1PFdPKAlH-m3MSNmTnugCwqx1ascYt_jGdgd24/edit?usp=sharing)
    * [PGCE/SD Computing SP16 - Group2 - Workspace](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNbc2odbQvAssrwSxgm2VH5dHbK_bUW25CrV33kz-Zk/edit?usp=sharing)
* Groups
    * There will be _breakout rooms_ setup that you should be able to freely move between (see the _people_ tab for an entrance arrow to each room)
    * I will ask for one member of each group to rotate/move group each activity (I will leave you to self organise)
    * The groups should be evenly balanced (as possible)

* After EIF in any order
    * Literacy (1hour30min) - Three breakout group activities
    * Numeracy (30min) - Lecture

Education Inspection Framework (EIF) (Async 45min + 30min breakout groups + 15min whole class == 1hour30min)
------------------------------------

ITT Core Content Framework

> 1.1. Teachers have the ability to affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of their pupils.

> 1.2. Teachers are key role models, who can influence the attitudes, values and behaviours of their pupils.

* I always refer my students to the assessment criteria. You are teachers. I will refer you to your _assessment criteria_. What criteria are schools inspected under?

TASK:
* Async Read + Consider questions below (45min)
    * [Ofsted: Inspections and performance of education providers](https://www.gov.uk/education/inspections-and-performance-of-education-providers)
        * [EIF](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/education-inspection-framework)
        * [School inspection handbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif)
            * Take note of interesting paragraph numbers to facilitate the discussion below
* Consider the following questions to discuss as a group (30min)
    1. What will inspectors consider when making judgements?
        * Subject specific criteria?
        * Other criteria? What are these other criteria and what evidence are they looking for?
    2. (Simply to spark discussion) What percentage or weighing of an Ofsted inspection could be subject-related/other-criteria-related/outside-of-your-control?
        * Your group will need to report your % or weightings and rational for the choice
    3. What actions could you and your department take to facilitate a successful Ofsted inspection?
        * Your group will compare your list with the other group - did you have something they missed? or vice versa?
        * (I hope you will take these as action points for your future work in schools)
* Whole class discussion (15min)




Literacy (1hour30min - 3 group activities)
--------

ITT Core Framework

> 3.10. Every teacher can improve pupils’ literacy, including by explicitly teaching reading, writing and oral language skills specific to individual disciplines

> 4.7. High-quality classroom talk can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary.

### What are schools expected to deliver?

* [Improving literacy in secondary schools a shared responsibility](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/413184/Improving_literacy_in_secondary_schools_-_report_summary.pdf) Ofsted 2013
    * > In the secondary schools where teachers in all subject departments had received training in teaching literacy and where staff had included an objective for literacy in all the lessons, senior managers noted an improvement in outcomes across all subjects, as well as in English.

### The Secret of Literacy

> Focussing on literacy objectives will not improve anything.
> Instead, what’s needed is for teachers to explicitly teach the language of their subject alongside their subject content.
> My slightly surprising insight is that if this is done well, the fact that children’s reading and writing improves is almost trivial.
> What really matters is that students get better at thinking.

[The Secret of Literacy: making the implicit explicit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Secret-Literacy-Making-implicit-explicit/dp/1781351279/) - [David Didau](https://learningspy.co.uk/literacy/what-to-do-about-literacy/) 2014 978-1781351277


* We need literacy to in order to think
* Language shapes how we think
* To think like a computer scientist you have to talk like a computer scientist

What is the tipping point from _'just using words that scientists use'_ and _'talking like a scientist'_?

* active/expressive vocabulary (words that are used autonomously)
* passive/receptive vocabulary (words that are understood and can be responded)

Figures (need to correlate exact source - these are from David Didau's book)
* Age 7 - top 25% have vocabulary of 7,100 words - bottom 25% 3,000 (parents?)
* Age 16 - 1 in 12 students has a working vocabulary of 800 words
* An average graduate has a vocabulary of 20,000 words

* [Matthew principle/effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect) - accumulated advantage (e.g. rich get richer)
* The young people that have a larger vocabulary have an ongoing compound interest advantage

### The _Language_ of Computer Science (20min)

> Some words have specific meaning in the computer science community, but a slightly or sometimes completely different meaning in everyday discourse (e.g. nouns like code, memory, address, folder, loop, bug, value, or verb to save, to code, to retrieve, to submit)

TASK: In your groups - expand the following table (15min group) + (5min whole class)
(My hope is that the list you generate could a useful resource for your future teaching)

| Computing Term | Possible connotation | Technical interpretation |
|-|-|-|
| Hot Key | The colour key on a graph referring to temperature | ? |
| Address | Where I live | ? |
| Inspect a log | From a tree, maybe it has ants | Filter/inspect historical system activity for diagnosis of issues |
| Submit a request | to kneel before an oppressor | A data request to an external/separate system |
| | _Expand this list_ | |


### Computing Vocabulary
Facilitating Meta-Discourse - Computer Science Education - Sentence 2019
1. Clarify meaning in other non-cs contexts
2. Speculation about possible meanings (what it could or could not be)
3. Develop CS related meaning

> Metaphors: The data is transferred -> I will move the file to another folder
> Computer is a living being: it fell asleep and woke up
> Always be explicit that these are metaphors!!!


Busch 1998

> I wrote a code
Professional developer interviewing for a position last week

> Unless we want to dumb down the curriculum to the point at which it's completely valueless, its impossible to penetrate the meaning of academic subjects using everyday language
<sub>David Didau</sub>

### Computer Science Phrases (20min)

I want explicitly incite you to explore/exercise your Computer Science terminology as part of this session.

* Examples of real computer science language
    * _do, while_ is an iteration pattern
    * What is the performance of the algorithm (n, n2, nlogn etc...)
    * Are these intermediary variables required in order to perform this comparison?
    * Does the algorithm fit the logic space of the problem (i.e. if you're looking for largest prime numbers, do you need to loop through all numbers?)
    * Can you identify any side effects that might be caused by changing state within this method?
    * Old cartridge based games consoles did not have an operating system
* Examples of rubbish mumbo jumbo
    * I'm hacking the mainframe
    * Reroute the encryption key through a blockchain
    * Use a trans-half reduction to ensure the AI reaches peak performance
    * You can compute the bubble sort maxima with an algorithm
* If you want inspiration
    * [wikipedia List_of_algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms)

TASK: Can you create a list of Computing phrases. Some that are _real_ and some that are _fake_. You could possible use this as a fun starter with your groups. Can they identify the nonsense from the real computer talk. You can then follow up with the class what the real ones mean. This is explicit vocabulary exercise.
* In your group breakout rooms: Add them to the Google Doc (15min)
    * It may be worth you categorising some of these with a difficulty level (maybe KS3, KS4, KS5)?
* Present to whole group (5min)

### Exam Board phrases

* [Glossary of GCSE command words from AQA](https://literacytrust.org.uk/resources/glossary-gcse-command-words-aqa/)
    * The language of exams - can be explicitly taught

### Computing Example: The language of (domain goes here)
Terminology example - [Premiere Pro - Ease In and Ease Out](https://youtu.be/vupwCdFgWpE?t=207) on [easing](https://easings.net/en)

> On my first job as a designer, I had no idea what my boss was asking me to do. Online, I had learned about “paper prototypes” and “iterating on mockups.” But here he was telling me to “sketch a wire” and “riff on that comp.” I felt like he was speaking another language.
<sub>[the-language-of-ux](https://uxdesign.cc/the-language-of-ux-e57d40c9792f)</sub>

#### Strategies to integrate _literacy_ into our classroom practice? (30min)

An Ofsted inspector has asked you "What strategies do you have in place to integrate _literacy_ into our classroom practice?"

In breakout groups consider strategies that you might be able to use (20min):

Think about:
* Assessment?
* How we present topics?
* How we create resources?
* How we setup our environment?

Notes in your Google doc group space.

Elect a spokesperson to report back (10min).

### Other references

#### Pop culture aside - StarTrek (as social commentary)

* Original StarTrek episode [Mirror, Mirror](http://www.chakoteya.net/StarTrek/39.htm) with a parallel universe evil enterprise. 
* A few of our original crew end up on the _evil enterprise_. They blended in by acting like assholes. 
* Meanwhile, the evil crew attempted to infiltrate the _good enterprise_ were immediately put in the brig.
* > KIRK: What I don't understand is how were you able to identify our counterparts so quickly?
* > SPOCK: It was far easier for you as civilised men to behave like barbarians, than it was for them as barbarians to behave like civilised men.
* Without the language you can't mimic the use of the language

### Finally

* Literacy could be considered more than a _skill_. It is the power to interact and understand the world.
* Check the EIF - how many times is literacy mentioned?




Numeracy (30min lecture)
--------

Numeracy allows us to understand the world

Computers are just giant calculators. Numeracy is the underpinning of our entire discipline.

            * [Hate Crime Statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hate-crime-statistics)
        * What is the population of the uk?

#### Questions

These could be discussion points

* What statistics in school research could be misused and misinterpreted
    * As humans (teacher and students alike) we need to _heavily scrutinise statistics_. (Especially _Education Research_)
* What activities in computing can we make numeracy explicit?
* How could we convey to students the context/power their numeracy might have in the future



Citizenship (Async 45min + 30min group + 10min whole)
-----------

> not undermining fundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect, and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs
<sub>[Teacher Standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards)</sub>


### Spiritual, Moral, Social and Cultural (SMSC)

Reading Async (20min)

    * > (Citizenship) equips pupils with the cultural capital they need to succeed in modern Britain
    * > The Association for Citizenship Teaching (ACT) recently tweeted news of the outcome of an Ofsted pilot visit with the new EIF where a school in Dorset was put into special measures because the deep dive showed that it failed to offer a sufficiently rich and balanced curriculum that included subjects and aspects such as Citizenship, FBV and could not fully promote pupils’ SMSC development. This underlines the dangers lurking for those schools that have downgraded their provision for Citizenship in the curriculum and their promotion of FBV and SMSC under the current inspection framework.
    * > there are very encouraging signs that schools will have considerable opportunities to make their Citizenship provision and its contribution to FBV and SMSC an explicit part of the curriculum and the conversations they have with inspectors

What implications will this have for your teaching of Computing?

Add some of your thoughts/notes/commentary to the Google Doc.
Do you all align? or are there different ideas within your group?
You will discuss these in your groups after the next set of reading.

### Digital Citizenship (Async 20min - Group Discuss 20min - 10min whole group)

Consider the question:
* Is digital citizenship my responsibility? How will this impact my future teaching?

When reading - consider:
* Education Inspection Framework - Citizenship, FBV and SMSC
* National Curriculum for Computing

Read the following report about Digital Citizenship (30min)

* [Digital Citizenship Report: Towards tomorrow’s successful digital citizens: providing the critical and dialogical opportunities to change lifestyles and mindsets](https://mirandanet.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Preston-Savage-et-al-FINAL_DigitalCitizens-Master-19nov15-CP-response-to-PB-commentary.pdf) 2019 mirandanet.ac.uk
    * > We suggest that skilled computer experts will provide a better service to society if they are able to understand and debate the benefits and dangers of computer literacy.
    * > This professional community believes the importance of ethics and values in relation to digital technologies are not emphasised sufficiently in today's digital society
    * Digital literacy 
        * is the ability to find, evaluate, utilize, share, and create content using information technologies and the Internet (Cornell University 2016).
    * Digital citizenship 
        * is the norms of appropriate, responsible behaviour with regard to technology use(Digital Citizenship 2016).
    * A Digital society is characterised by three cultures:
        * Digital tools 
            * which allow humans to maintain his/her social life in the digital society and considered as the ground for other elements of the digital culture.
        * Digital values 
            * which form a belief system that provides meanings or goals for human behaviours or social activities in the digital society.
        * Digital norms 
            * which represents normative procedures and rules that are socially acknowledged in carrying out digital activities (Kwon et al.)
    * Digital Equity 
        * is the social justice goal of ensuring that everyone in our society has equal access to technology tools, computers and the Internet. It is when all individuals have the knowledge and skills to access and use technology tools, computers and the Internet.
    * Digital wisdom 
        * is the ability of individuals and/or societies to make informed decisions in relation to the appropriate use and exploitation of information technology in all its forms

### Group (30min)

Return to your group breakout rooms and discuss 
* What implications will the citizenship guidance have for your teaching of Computing?
* Is digital citizenship my responsibility? How will this impact my future teaching?

Youth Language (30min group)
--------------

* Try to be aware of the language the youth in your school are using. It could be important for you spotting abuse or intimidation.
    * Most of the time the students LOVE talking about this to teachers. They love the reversal of knowing something more than the teacher. These are good lunchtime conversations.

Careers Advice to Students (15min lecture + 15min async reading)
--------------------------

* Are we careers experts in every profession? ... no ... we are teachers with limited knowledge of the entire economy.
* Do we know what the job market will be like in 20 years times and what skills will be in demand ... no ... 
* Should we be proclaiming to young people we know about their future ... probably not .. 

I think there are some fundamentals we can ascertain

* As professionals we are (part of) laying the foundations for the rest of their lives.
* As a professional we are guiding young people to be confident, competent, stable, communities.
* The idealistic "follow your dreams" feels selfish/elitist and only half the story.
* The full quote should read "Support your community, to facilitate following your dreams".

> Satisfaction comes from *experience* not _passion_

[So Good They Can't Ignore You](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/0349415862) - [Cal Newport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Newport)

> Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country

[Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_John_F._Kennedy)

I don't like the term _country_ - so I suggest a replacement of _community_

* There are plenty of roles that society needs.
* Why would you deliberately ignore what society needs to live your life in your own self indulgent bubble?
* Many students cite desired occupations as: 
    * Singer (X-Factor), Game Designer, Actor, Film Director, YouTuber, Steamer, Footballer.
    * Because that is the only world they know.
* This narrow view is understandable; it's ultimately the failing of adults ability to convey the concept of _society_ and _community_ to young people.
* We need to stop indulging our young people. We risk creating a generation that are self-obsessed and self-entitled and lack a wider perspective.

* [Spheres of influence: what shapes young people’s aspirations at age 12/13 and what are the implications for education policy?](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02680939.2013.790079) Louise Archer 2013
    * > We demonstrate how aspirations are shaped by structural forces (e.g. social class, gender and ethnicity) and how different spheres of influence (home/family, school, hobbies/leisure activities and TV) appear to shape different types of aspirations. The paper concludes by considering the implications for educational policy and careers education.

* Skill up to assist your community.
    * Get satisfaction from it.
    * Get recondition for it.
    * Get revenue for it.

Use the extra financial capability to fund what you want to do. Be it travelling, starting a family, facilitating your own creative projects or adventures.
If they don't get a career and contribute back to society they are going to have problems.

This question isn’t new to us. So while hearing it will certainly make our stomachs drop, it’ll also just straight-up piss us off, and we will 100% “ok boomer” your ass (behind your back, to our cousins).

    * > To be satisfied with a job, you don’t have to worry too much about finding a perfect fit for your interests because we know other things matter, too. As long as it’s something you don’t hate doing, you may find yourself very satisfied if you have a good supervisor, like your co-workers, and are treated fairly by your organization.
    * > Being interested in your work seems more important for job performance and the downstream consequences of performing well, like raises or promotions.
    * > In popular career guidance literature, it is widely assumed that interest fit is important for job satisfaction. Our results show that people who are more interested in their jobs tend to be slightly more satisfied, but interest assessments are more useful for guiding people towards jobs in which they will perform better and make more money.

Teaching for Character (in progress)
----------------------

We have now ascertained we are teaching character traits. So what language can we use to describe these traits?

> 1.x Using intentional and consistent language that promotes challenge and aspiration.

> 7.3. The ability to self-regulate one’s emotions affects pupils’ ability to learn, success in school and future lives.

> 7.4. Teachers can influence pupils’ resilience and beliefs about their ability to succeed, by ensuring all pupils have the opportunity to experience meaningful success.

My background:
* Poor literacy, bad handwriting, bad spelling
* Mother beside herself with grief and tears; that her son would be unable to function in the world
* I got extra time in all my exams in school and University
* My PGCE (Different course back then) Failed my online literacy test 3 times
* In my NQT year I spelt _The Simpsons_ incorrectly and my bottom set year 7 laughed
* My handwriting today is difficult for even me to read back
* I played a group game over near year where I had to draw a 'Judge' and I thought it said 'Jungle' and I drew a 'Jungle' when everyone else drew a Judge.
* I don't in any way identify myself as dyslexic or dyspraxic. Labels are utterly irrelevant in the roles I need to perform.
* Yet in spite of that I am a successful working professional. Considered by peers exceptionally literate, informed and well read.

Literacy
--------

Hirsch
reading should not be used to teach new topics - too much cgnative load - use reading to improve vocabulary and knowlege of existing are
cunninghan and stanovich - read volume in early years to improve

the activities that follow the reading are just as important as the reading itself

okenhill
depth of wor knowlege and ability to make inferences
activities designed to decode words and understand language should require prior knowlege and understanding

vocabulary should be revisited in different ways to cement it
collaborative learning. studets should be given the oppertunity to discuss vocabulary

DARTS - directed activities relating to texts - analyse or reconstruct
highlight words in different categories (e.g words they did not understand is a category)
match key words to their defenitions
treasure hunt: find specific types of words and describe their purpose
fill in the blanks: -> then make their own fill in the blanks activity (improve vocab and sentence structure)


read individaually (with scaffold) then read again as class

reading should be used to summerise previously learnt content
vocabulary activities related to readin should have a specific purpose, encouage recall and challange
vocabulary development should be a mixture of indipendent and collaborative learning (individually for assessment)
