Computing Across the Curriculum
===============================

Objectives
----------

Up until this point you've been starting your journey of mechanically teaching computing topics discreetly.
Consider the semantic difference between "A Computing teacher" and "A teacher that has a specialism in Computing".
(I want this session to challenge your perception of your role)

* Understand the power of context based learning
    * Computing can relate to everything in our world and lives
* Consider how we can support our fellow teaching colleges with our Computing skills

### Spotlight questions
* What is a broad and balanced curriculum?
* How do you lead learning?
* (Echo back to) What is a Teacher?

### ITT Core Framework

1.2. 
> Teachers are key role models, who can influence the attitudes, values and behaviours of their pupils

3.1.
> A school’s curriculum enables it to set out its vision for the knowledge, skills and values that its pupils will learn, encompassing the national curriculum within a coherent wider vision for successful learning

3.8.
> Pupils are likely to struggle to transfer what has been learnt in one discipline to a new or unfamiliar context.

> Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to revisit the big ideas of the subject over time and teach key concepts through a range of examples.

8.3
> Teachers can make valuable contributions to the wider life of the school in a broad range of ways, including by supporting and developing effective professional relationships with colleagues


Pre task - Async task (1 hour)
--------

Next session we are looking at "Computing Across the Curriculum".
* Imagine that Computing did not exist as it's own subject and you were employed by a school to integrate computing across the teaching of other subjects.
* Brainstorm and investigate as many ideas as possible.
* How does Computing relate to each subject? (does it?)
* How could a lesson/activity be structured to bridge multiple subjects?
Come prepared to next weeks session with suggestions so we can embark on a discussion.


Introduction (whole group 15min to 30min?)
------------

Shared whiteboard for ideas followed by discussion.

* Scenario: Computing does not exist as a subject on it's own.
* What would Computing in schools look like?
* How could it be done?
* What would the issues be? What would be the benefits?


Ofsted and Computing (lecture 10min)
---------------------

* National Curriculum
    * > A high-quality computing eduction equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world
    * > Computing has deeps links with mathematics, science and design and technology, and provides insight into both natural and artificial systems.
* [David Drown HMI](https://www.slideshare.net/Ofstednews/inspection-computing-and-e-safety-in-schools) 2014 (stepped down)
    * Teaching in computing is good or better when:
        * it is rooted in the development of pupils’ understanding of important concepts and progression within the lesson and over time; it enables pupils to make connections between individual topics and to see the *big picture*
        * teachers use a very wide range of innovative and imaginative resources and teaching strategies to stimulate pupils’ *active participation* in their learning and secure good or better progress across all aspects of the subject.
    * The computing curriculum is good or better when:
        * the contexts in which computing is taught are *relevant to pupils lives* and reflect the increasing use of computing in the world of industry
        * excellent links are forged with other agencies and the *wider community* to provide a wide range of enrichment activities to promote pupils’ learning and engagement with the subject
        * *links with other subjects in the school* are productive in strengthening pupils’ learning in computing
    * Leadership of computing is good or better when
        * there are effective strategies to delegate subject responsibilities where appropriate and to share good practice
        * computing has a very high profile in the life of the school
    * Finally ...
        * E-safety is now considered in the inspection of all education remits including the early years sector, further education and skills, and initial teacher education.

Responsibility's of Computing Teachers (lecture 10min)
--------------------------------------

* 3 strands
    * Computer science
    * Information technology
        * not a discrete subject - is supposed to be taught across the curriculum
    * Digital literacy
        * not a discrete subject - is supposed to be conveyed across the curriculum

* As computing teachers we must support:
    * our schools with ICT and digital literacy
        * Very few other teachers will have a background in Computing. Their digital literacy is often weak.
        * Other subjects/staff will need support from you to train them in some aspects of computers (ICT and Computing) for their class's
        * We should consider this _support_ part of our role in schools
    * our subject with strong cross curricular links
        * Literacy
            * [Ofsted Improving literacy in secondary schools: a shared responsibility](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/improving-literacy-in-secondary-schools-a-shared-responsibility)
                > Our world is dominated by the written word, both online and in print. This means we can only contribute and participate actively if we can read and write sufficiently well.

                > where staff had included an objective for literacy in all the lessons, senior managers noted an improvement in outcomes across all subjects
            * Use precise language
                * Many young people cannot convey there ideas (verbally or written)
                * If you can't describe/distil your ideas - you cannot think
                * Subject vocabulary to describe complex problems efficiently
            * [The Secret of Literacy: Making the implicit, explicit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Secret-Literacy-Making-implicit-explicit/dp/1781351279/)

            * [Programmers-Introduction-Mathematics](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programmers-Introduction-Mathematics-Dr-Jeremy/dp/1727125452/)

* Your role
    * You *ARE* the evangelist/ambassador for Computing in your school. For staff and students alike
    * Your enthusiasm and knowledge should permeate the air and infect the people around you
    * You need to convey how Computing changes us and our world

### Computing Terminology cross curricular

These terms could be applied to _all_ subjects.
Can you help other practitioners include these words explicitly in their lessons?

* Logic
    * predicting analysing
* Algorithms
    * making steps & rules
* Decomposition
    * breaking down into parts
* Patterns
    * spotting using similarity's
* Abstraction
    * removing unnecessary detail
    * [picasso abstract bull](https://www.google.com/search?q=picasso+abstract+bull&tbm=isch)
* Evaluation
    * making judgement

### Planning cross curricular

* How can it be done? Possible options:
    * Discreet Computing lessons reference other subsect areas
        * You using your creativity
        * You invite other subject specialists to be involved in Computing planning
    * Other subject lessons reference Computing concepts
        * As a computing specialist you are involved/consulted in other subjects planning
        * [English: making links with the Computing curriculum](https://www.somerset.org.uk/sites/edtech/Primary%20Computing/Computing%20across%20curriculum/English%20and%20computing.pdf)
            * > Decomposition is used to analyse sentence construction including the recognition of a clause, conjunctions, adverbs and prepositions.
                * See `grammar.py` example later
        * TODO: I want more examples
    * Integrated curriculum - there are no subjects

Don't wait for leadership to tell you what to do.
Get involved with other subjects teachers!

        * Goodhearts Law - once a useful number becomes a measure of success, it ceases to be a useful number.
        *  Textile factories were required to produce quantities of fabric that were specified by length, and so looms were adjusted to make long, narrow strips. 
        *  Uzbek cotton pickers, judged on the weight of their harvest, would soak their cotton in water to make it heavier. 
        *  America’s first transcontinental railroad was built, in the eighteen-sixties, companies were paid per mile of track. So a section outside Omaha, Nebraska, was laid down in a wide arc, rather than a straight line, adding several unnecessary (yet profitable) miles to the rails. 
        * data “may be a pretty decent proxy for something that really matters,” but there’s a critical gap between even the best proxies and the real thing—between what we’re able to measure and what we actually care about.
        * > There are echoes of this in the questions that society aims to answer using data, with a well-known example concerning schools. We might be interested in whether our children are getting a good education, but it’s very hard to pin down exactly what we mean by “good.” Instead, we tend to ask a related and easier question: How well do students perform when examined on some corpus of fact? And so we get the much lamented “teach to the test” syndrome.
        * > For that matter, think about our use of G.D.P. to indicate a country’s economic well-being. By that metric, a schoolteacher could contribute more to a nation’s economic success by assaulting a student and being sent to a high-security prison than by educating the student, owing to all the labor that the teacher’s incarceration would create.
        * > To simplify the world enough that it can be captured with numbers means throwing away a lot of detail. The inevitable omissions can bias the data against certain groups.
        * > Harford gives the example of two sheep in a field: “Except that one of the sheep isn’t a sheep, it’s a lamb. And the other sheep is heavily pregnant—in fact, she’s in labor, about to give birth at any moment. How many sheep again?”
        * Child development model (4 data points) - DOB, Mothers education, marital status, ethnicity - 20% accuracy
        * thirteen thousand data points on each child - sophisticated modules predicted at +-3% accuracy
        * > Numbers are a poor substitute for the richness and color of the real world.
