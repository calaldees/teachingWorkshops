Reflective practice
===================

* We are not training you to teach like us
* We are training you to redefine the professions



* Up until now you have been _taught at_. You've been told what to learn and how to learn it.
* At postgraduate level - there are 'no answers'



* [The Biggest Myth In Education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhgwIhB58PA) - learning styles verbasium YouYube 15min?
    * you are not a visual learner
    * be critical


* [What are we doing? Are we all doing it?](https://bennewmark.wordpress.com/2021/06/22/what-are-we-doing-are-we-all-doing-it/)
    * Lesson observations are not sufficient for knowing is teaching is effective
    * Observers look for a focused environment where student know what they are doing
    * This is a poor proxy for "learning", but it is an effective proxy


* So much of what we know about education is incomplete and possibly wrong
* Education is a new thing; We've only been sitting at desks for 100 years. Before that EVERYTHGIN was apprenticeships





Criticality and learning to think
---------------------------------

* Metaphor "routing around in the grass"
    * Snake in the grass?
    * evolution makes us not hang around to find out
    * We know!! The risk/cost of investigating is too high
    * When we are certain - we don't think
    * "routing around in the grass" to find out is dangerous
    * Modern society (mostly) is not instant death.
    * If we even see people routing around in the grass we tut and sigh and roll our eye's because we know that it could be a snake.
    * Don't stop other for routing around in the grass. Start digging yourself.

* Duck or rabbit?
    * ![Duck or Rabbit](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shane-Oneill-5/publication/232927441/figure/fig1/AS:669948519120911@1536739582541/Duck-rabbit-drawing.png)
    * We are debating over interpretation. It is not either, it's just some lines

If we cant agree what education is for, then we will be unable to agree on how to improve it.
David Daiau 

* Someone's _fault_ or _process is at fault_?





[Are We Preparing or Training Teachers? Developing Professional Judgement in and Beyond Teacher Preparation Programs](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022487117702584) [padlet](https://padlet-uploads.storage.googleapis.com/620776567/c1f78b95d4d4ba6b8911b4ea271a0184/Are_we_preparing_or_training_teachers.pdf) Scales 2018

> "Pedagogy does not often survive contact with the classroom" (Lynch, 2013, p. xv).
> Lynch suggests learning to teach must be a combination of views about teaching that candidates bring to programs along with experience.
> Lynch calls this the Tuesday morning question:
> What will teachers do after they have had the experience of Monday?
> He asserts that
> learning from experience is possible through theories of pedagogy,
> but pedagogy without experience is meaningless

> How can programs prepare candidates for complex teaching situations that may not match coursework exactly? 
> Learning to teach literacy is not simply learning content, skills, and strategies, 
> but a way to think about teaching as a flexible, adaptive process 
> that takes into account district requirements, school culture, teacher expertise, curricular demands, and students’ needs.
> Teachers need to make professional judgements during teaching, 
> and perhaps even become subversive in adaptations, depending on their teaching contexts.
>
> This begins in coursework where teacher educators should help candidates understand when, where, and how to be advocates for a different stance.
> Indeed, we are not advocates of replicating program instructors or a “Clone Army” (McCallum & Lucas, 2002) of teachers who compliantly do as they are told.

* Actions (leaver)
    * Immediate actions
    * Future points (How will you come back to these?)
        * Behaviours? Cumulative?
* Measure impact (how will you know it has had an effect)
    * Cross-reference your actions

You need a note taking system.
Your note taking system should be online and transparent.

* Every subject session has progress, evidence and actions
    * You record
        * Action points
        * Reflections
    * My records
        * Comments on each student for each session
        * Monitor Engagement
            * If I was asked 'How is StudentX engaging with the subject sessions'. I could respond by pointing them at your action points and reflections for 'each session.
        * I could be asked to justify your progress
            * e.g last year when lockdown happened - educators asked to predict on trajectory
            * I will be part of a panel of professionals that could be asked about your progress

    * > The use of journals by students while on placement is a well-accepted strategy for encouraging reflection on practice, with the use of online blogs for this purpose potentially providing additional benefits through shared reflection and peer support. The aim of this study was to explore the effectiveness of an online blogging activity by teacher education students while on professional placement in schools.
