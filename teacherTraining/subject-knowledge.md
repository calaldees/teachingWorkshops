(Old) Subject Knowledge Audit
=============================

[old worddoc blackboard](https://learn.canterbury.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-2669165-dt-content-rid-3995226_1/xid-3995226_1)

Tracker and Audit.

* to help you know what subject knowledge means for your subject
* to help you identify your strengths and areas for development in subject knowledge
* to enable you to bridge the gaps in your subject knowledge before you start the course


No teacher knows everything about their subject.
There is no defined list of topics or other information that must be known by subject practitioners.
But it is important that you have the fundamental concepts, as set out in this audit, in place.

Subject knowledge in the National Curriculum Programme of Study is not in the form of specific factual content as is found in most other subjects.
It is rather more related to skills, knowledge and understanding of concepts.

You need to appreciate that you will take responsibility for learning new material and raising your level of subject knowledge or software skills, especially when working in schools on placements.
Your subject tutors, mentors and other teachers can help with resources and in other ways, but this is an aspect of the course in which you need to develop independent strategies for learning.
