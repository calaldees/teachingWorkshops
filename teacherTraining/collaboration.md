Teacher Collaboration (15 min)
=====================

### Plain office documents

* Somewhat portable
* Understandable by most people
* Prone to corruption/dataloss
* Transmission
    * Email
    * Website (upload)
    * Dropbox
        * Versions (for 2 weeks)

Problems
* No change log
* Contributing changes back to the author is hard/manual/complex/time-consuming
* fragmented (people have different versions) that are inaccessible from the original
* Difficult to search content (searching for text inside an individual slide of a sideshow)
* Struggle to meet legal accessibility standards
* Data is locked in formats of propriety software


### Cloud Based Office Documents

* Single point of truth always accessible
* Multiple editors
* Comments system

Problems
* Anyone can change anything at anytime
    * Someone could just remove chunks of information you consider important or still need
* Limited log of changes
* Difficult to search text deep in documents
* 3rd Party tech companies control your data


### Version control (with text representation)

* Point of truth always accessible
* Multiple editors
* Contributions go through a review/consultation process
* Every previous version is tracked and accessible
* Content is searchable
* Meets legal accessibility standards

Problems
* Learning curve to make contributions

Teacher collaboration is an ongoing interest of mine. We don't have the tools or comunity locally. I want to investigate and change this.

Student Collaboration (30 min)
=====================

### Online

    * [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/)
    * [Microsoft Office 365](https://www.office.com/)
* Shared boards
    * [Miro](https://miro.com/)

    * [Wireflow](https://wireflow.co/) - Open source collaborative website flow diagrams
* General
    * [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) - Annotate the web, with anyone, anywhere
* Setup a Computing Discord/Slack server
    * `#code`,`#cooltech`,`#random`
    * 6th formers moderate?
* Links to calendar entries (for deadlines)


TASK: What other collaboration tools have you encountered that you think could be useful in an school setting?

### Version Control

Benefits of using public code-repositories version-control (GitHub/GitLab)
* As a teacher
    * See timestamped progress
    * Reproduce issue + Offer support as merge request
    * Run automated tests on student code (imagine your marking being automated?)
* As a student
    * Roll back to working versions
    * Experience with professional tools
    * No excuses for loosing work

All on the same team, all with the same objective.
Professional developers SHARE ALL THEIR CODE AT ALL TIMES.

Copying *is* a part of learning. Reading code. Reference sources.
* GCSE: Exam is paper based
* AS: Assessment is solo on a computer
* A2: Project is individual
You will easily be able to spot any student that copies code and submits summative assessment to you without understanding.

#### Online code environments

[repl.it](https://repl.it/) is an education revolution
* No reliance on school infrastructure
* Variety of languages
* Terminal and graphical (pygame) apps
* Multi-user live pair programming
* Simple integration with GitHub version control
    * Spawn repl from a GitHub template (your stub task)
    * Auto marking and Audit/commit history of students work
    * Commenting

What does it mean?

It is vital to distinguish between structured team learning and informal group learning. Structured team learning – or cooperative learning – has yielded strong results in trials when there are two conditions in place:

* Group goals
    * The aim of the task must be to achieve success in something purposeful, possibly to gain a reward of some kind. It isn’t enough to work in a team without a clear goal.
* Individual accountability
    * The success of each student in terms of their learning must contribute to the overall team success, otherwise some students dominate the task and others become passengers.

It is common for teachers to deploy informal group learning where these conditions do not apply. This can weaken learning gains and reduce their effectiveness when compared with individual working.
What are the implications for teachers?

This is a classic example of it being ‘the way you do it’ that gets results. In general, don’t do group work for the sake of it or without taking account of the conditions in which it is effective. Group work is not inherently a good idea or a bad idea, its effectiveness depends on what you want students to learn and how you organise the groups.

If students are all to succeed, the task must be designed so they have to help and challenge each other. This links to Dylan Wiliam’s idea of students learning to act as resources for each other to generate formative feedback. It is also important that they all have a clear role. Every student’s contribution must matter and no one student should be able to opt out or hang back while the others do all the thinking.

Also stick to smaller groups (pairs and threes) because it is harder to ensure there is accountability and defined roles as the number of students in the group increases (this is known as the Ringelmann effect).
Top tip
Consider whether students might learn more doing a task by themselves or whether a group task would help to push all the students forward in their thinking, or support practice and formative assessment.
