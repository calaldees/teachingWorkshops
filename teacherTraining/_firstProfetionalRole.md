===================================================

Supplemental discussion session
1 Hour

Welcome!
I'm Allan (Subject Tutor for Computing)

(A link to this document will be provided at the end of the session)

While others are joining ...

TASK: What is professional?
Type in the chat - words/phases/behaviours you would associate with being a  _professional_.


I have heard the phrase
> Teachers are pillars of our society

We are *role models for our society's future*
... that's a fairly significant responsibility


Basics
------

* Be punctual and reliable
* Dressed appropriately
    * Hair well kept
* Keep your phone off
    * Focus on your role (There is little _downtime_ in schools)
* Do not discuss politics or religion at your place of work
    * This will likely alienate people. It is not relevant to your role.
* Your colleagues do not need to be your friends
    * You can respect them as professionals effectively and interact with them but still not like them


Personal Attitude
-----------------

* Be 100% yourself, but watch your terminology/language
    * You can be a professional *and* still be a badass
* Be proactive
    * Don't expect somebody else to fix your problems automatically


Courageous Leadership
---------------------

You have a duty of care over your students.
I would like to extend that to.
You have a duty of care over your team (this includes your colleges).
Your have some element of control over your teams emotional state.

> Let's all choose to be the leaders we wish we had

<sub>Simon Sinek</sub>

* Conduct yourself properly
    * Who would you trust
        * Heart surgeon flapping arms around and shouting 'oh no there is blood everywhere'
        * Heart surgeon calming explaining the breach and asking for the next tool
* Be mindful of cyclic negativity. Don't _whinge_.
    * Identify problems - collate/suggest solutions - take action points
* Identify the *spirit* of conversations
    * Are you colleagues being offensive? or are they expressing frustration?


Language
--------

> I'm disinclined to acquiesce your request.
> It means "No"

<sub>Pirates of the Caribbean</sub>


TASK: What alternate language could we use to relay these feelings in a professional context?
* It's shit
* Doing this takes too long
* X is an idiot!
* I can't do this
* he doesn't like me 

Possible suggestions
* This is not optimal/ideal
* I feel the time I am spending on X is disproportionate
* X struggles with Y
* I'm struggling with X
* there is a failure of trust in this relationship

Summary
* If you talk like a child you will be treated like child
* If you talk like a professional you will be treated like professional


### Plain English

*Everyone* should read this.
It will take time to master.

* [How to write in plain English](http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/how-to-write-in-plain-english.html)
    * Keep your sentences short
    * Use 'you' and 'we'
    * Use words that are appropriate for the reader
    * Don't be afraid to give instructions
    * Avoid nominalisations
    * Use lists where appropriate
    * Prefer active verbs
        * This matter will be considered by us shortly. (Passive)
        * We will consider this matter shortly. (Active)
        * The riot was stopped by the police. (Passive)
        * The police stopped the riot. (Active)
        * The mine had to be closed by the authority. (Passive)
        * The authority had to close the mine. (Active)


Business Process
----------------

Business's are living breathing systems.
There are established
* Process's
    * When/how you can search a child? or confiscate their items?
    * What behaviour should you report, and to who?
* Channels of communication
    * How do you report your absence?
    * One does not simply - send an email to headteacher?
* Codes of conduct
    * What standards are you required to hold?

[Bianca Williams: Sprinter says 'I've never had to experience anything like this'](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/53305712)
> Officers from the Directorate of Professional Standards have reviewed both footage from social media, and the body-worn video of the officers, and are satisfied that there is no concern around the officers' conduct.
(But that did'nt stick
[Bianca Williams stop-and-search: Met PCs face probe](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-54466254))

When you tackle _issues_, you should consider if issue is with the _process_ or the issue is with the _individual_.

### Business Comms/Handbooks/Training

You will have induction packs/training.
As a member of staff you are expected to know all of it.
Ignorance is not an excuse.

Many organisations have online e-learning. 
You have to tick a box to say I've read this.

Is it the _organisations_ fault or _your_ fault?

If you've ticked the box - then you should know - It's your fault.

### Summary of national process's for schools

* Handbook for Educational Professionals: The Bristol Guide 2020/21
    * [Printed](https://bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/handbook-for-educational-professionals-the-bristol-guide-202021) £6.50
    * [Amazon Kindle](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Handbook-Education-Professionals-2020-21-ebook/dp/B08DYGBCHR/) £5

* When/how is appropriate to search a student?
* Is the school responsible for bullying outside the school premises?

### Problems with business process?

If you feel the business process has treated you unfairly and you need further advice. This is what a union is for. Join one!

* [Teacher Unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teachers%27_trade_unions_in_the_United_Kingdom)

After this talk read up on what the unions stand for.
Some unions believe that _striking_ is too aggressive and considers _chalk-downs_.
Research your unions principles.

### Rules

TASK: Why do rules/process/systems exist?
Answers in the chat


* Consistency
    * Across a large geographic area
* The presence of a rule (hopefully) creates a better outcome (than no rule)
* As an individual you may not be aware of all possible situations and their knock-on effects.
    * You can't do this deep thinking in the spur of the moment
    * You can't have the understanding or perspective of all stakeholders at all times


Formal Communication
--------------------

### Email

Email is a _formal_ means of communication.
* It is recorded.
* It is evidence.
* It is tracked.

Why is email so important?
* Verbally - things get lost/forgotten/don't-exist
* Email - It becomes real/tangible/trackable

Tips:
* Learn how to use _cc_ and _bcc_ effectively
* Use 'reply' and 'replyall' effectively
* You need to be able to cope with significant volumes of email with limited time
    * Setup email filter rules to automatically sort incoming email into folders
* Consider every single email _public domain_. Anyone can make a GDPR subject access request and demand all the data an organisation holds on them (including every email ever sent)
    * Do not make snide/condescending comments or jokes about children/staff/parents/ANYONE with your work email address. Keep EVERY message professional.
        * (Convey sensitive information or voice your internal emotional state to other staff verbally)


My Stories
----------

Stories from my early teaching career

* "Do not refer to students as Dude", "Yes Master"
* "No you muppet, you've got the CD"
* 6th form group complaint discussion




Summary
-------

* Use _precise_ language
* Conduct your actions with _integrity_
* Have knowledge of your role/organisation
    * Understand business process
* _Actively_ Perform your expected _role_

The defined trait of a professional is someone that can 
> exercise discretionary judgement

Unsorted Notes
==============

> A strong sense of teacher _professional identity_ is linked to the retention of teachers within the profession <sub>Jim Zimmer - Dean, Facalty of Teaching and Learning</sub>


Interacting with your mentor
----------------------------

* [What informs mentors' practice when working with trainees and newly qualified teachers? An investigation into mentors' professional knowledge base](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02607470600655227) 2007 Jones M, Straker K
    * > (mentors) described as challenging working with ‘weak’ or ‘unwilling’ trainees, dealing with trainees' personal stress and mediating between trainee and colleagues
* Mentors are not your agony aunt or therapist. You have a professional role to perform.
