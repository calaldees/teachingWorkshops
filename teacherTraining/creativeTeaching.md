Creative Teaching
=================

* Teach a prescribed curriculum - assessed centrally
    * Lack of risk taking
* Where session slides are created centrally and teachers are expected to follow them, in the name of standardisation.
    * The internet is now here .. trainees can just download resources rather than make them
* OFSTED resorts and inspection guidance don't focus on creativity.
    * Has a school ever failed an inspection by being not creative/reflective enough?
* [ITT core content framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-itt-core-content-framework) (2019) - does not mention creativity
* 'good behaviour' is valued more than creativity....?
* Trainees prefer didactic and transmissive teaching mechanisms


TASK: Discuss - 
* agree/disagree - why?
* Are we allowed to be creative?
* Do we value creativity?
* Should we bo creative in our teaching?

<details>

my notes

* Can creativity be prescribed? - on-demand
* How can creativity be recognised? (my maze butterfly pin wheel)
* mini C - value to the learner - 6 year old drawing
* little c - 

* "The Creativity Conundrum"
    * base skills - louie armstrong cant be creative if he doesnt know what end of the trumpet to blow into
    * pallet of skills

Nobody can become autonomous leaner without being creative
Risks required for _outstanding_
encourage trainees to be subversive!


Is we are creative, how does that help them?

Can't just go from 0 to creative

    * Hodges (2005, p4)
        * > 'learning, motivation and enjoyment' are compromised at the cost of assessment targets
    * This build on the definition from NACCCEE (1999) that defines creativity as 'imaginative activity fashioned to produce outcomes that are both original and of value' (p30)
* [The Durham Commission on Creativity in Education](https://www.dur.ac.uk/creativitycommission/report/) 2020
    * Definitions (pg4)
        * Creativity: 
            * The capacity to imagine, conceive, express, or make something that was not there before
        * Creative thinking: 
            * A process through which knowledge, intuition and skills are applied to imagine, express or make something novel or individual in its contexts. Creative thinking is present in all areas of life. It may appear spontaneous, but it can be underpinned by perseverance, experimentation, critical thinking and collaboration
        * Teaching for creativity: 
            * Explicitly using pedagogies and practices that cultivate creativity in young people
    * > Unless an aspect of creativity is specified by a particular syllabus it is unlikely to be developed in busy, results-concious schools. Many examinations at GCSE level and above invariably focus on knowledge recall and leave less scope for creative questioning and problem-solving, or the exercise of curiosity though deep enquiry

    * [10 Recommendations](https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/download-file/Durham_Commission_on_Creativity_04112019_0.pdf)
        * should be recognised in the Ofsted inspection process
        * Higher education institutions ... to develop research informed practice to evaluate creativity, looking at how creativity and creative thinking can be identified across disciplines, and how its impact can be measured.
        * training for teachers in digital literacy and digital creativity, with time and resource committed to it.
        *  diverse routes to take part in creative activities outside of school hours.


* Collard and Looney (2014) argue that for learning to be creative, teachers need to see creativity as a process in which they 'build learners' own competence to assess the quality of their ideas.
    * confidence issue - because of differing definitions and policy offered to educators
        * pg 49

Flow Theory
-----------

[Flow in Education](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080448947006084) Schmidt 2010
* Graph
    * Challenge Low->High
    * Skill Low->High
    * (more challenge than skill == anxiety)
    * (more skill than challenge == boredom)
* Abstract
    * Flow refers to a state of total absorption in the task at hand; a merging of action and experience where the individual loses track of both time and self. 
    * Researchers have identified several conditions under which the flow experience tends to emerge. 
    * Two of these conditions – high levels of challenge matched to an individual’s skills – are often present in educational environments, 
    * but other important conditions are largely absent in classrooms, with the result that students do not experience flow in school as often as one might expect.



risk taking (40min)
------------------

Support trainee teachers to take risks - mentor conversation?

* We can keep things 'safe' in the same cookie cutter ...
* We can't get better unless we try new ideas ...
* Consider: 
    * Cross curricular (see broad and balanced curriculum)
    * External to the school?

* TASK1 (10min): Individual: Consider a range of teaching strategies and ideas that you would be interested in trying in you ECT years
* TASK2 (10min): Pairs: Discuss ideas. What would be the 'risk' in trying these ideas? How could we reduce the risk?
* TASK3 (10min): Whole group relay
(10min): Tutor ideas ...

Consider:
* 'SLT Test' - If SLT walked in, would you be able to justify your approach

<details>

* 'Game' or 'Phone' test plan - tick list
* School Field (Networks)
* Screwdriver + Computer + Put back together
* Competition with another class (clear criteria?)
* Anonymous peer marking (test software?)
* Ask for genuine feedback - students struggle with writing (literacy?) - allow verbal discussion with your outside (window wave 10-15min?) - class rep? (must relay all ideas even if they do not agree with them) - provide scaffold focus points. Simplify "I don't mind if you don't like me. I do mind if you do not feel that you've made progress". Formative for me/teacher. It's hard to look in the mirror.

* After Christmas? (You have to know your class)

* Organising game tournaments (over to them!)
