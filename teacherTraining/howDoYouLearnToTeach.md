Session 1 - How do you learn to teach
=====================================

Induction to programme materials, structure and professional engagement


* Christ Church: course overview, resources, paperwork, support
* Reflection, tooling and ways of working this year
* High level overview of Computing and perceptions


Introductions
-------------

### Who am I?

My background
* 7 years teaching ICT and Computing in secondary schools - Practical battle experience
* 10 years as a senior developer in central London across a range of domains
* 2 years (part-time) supporting CCCU Computing subject sessions
* My weakness is _cutting edge research_ and _teaching theory_
    * I will be working towards this throughout the year

I have my own ideas about how to teach computing
* Multiple languages at once
* Freedom (self direct-ish)/project based
* Unit tests
* Pair programming (talking about code and collaborating)
* Version control
But this course is not about my _opinions_ about my preferred teaching methods, 
it is about critically developing your own subject pedagogy knowledge.

### Who are you?

TASK: 120 second summary
* Rough background (education, work)
* Course: PGCE, 7-14 or SchoolDirect?

<sub>side-note: Computing teachers mindsets - compared to other subject practitioners - feel trapped</sub>

The burden of learning to teach - the _expert beginner_
Primary->Secondary->Uni->Carear1Employment1->Carear2Employment2->Retraining->Carear2Employment1

### Mini survey

Visual Thumb-up-o-meter
* Multiple programming languages (to an autonomous level)
* Version control
* Linux

### Lighthouse statement

You've made a lighthouse statement about _who you are_ and _why you want to teach_.
I made a lighthouse statement at the start of my teacher training PGCE.
I read it back at the end of my PGCE year.
I could not identify with it.
It was some words that babaled about _making a difference_. It was unstructured idealist nonsense.
I could not believe how much the year had changed me.

This year will change you.

This is a wonderful example of
> When you learn something, you are perminatly changed.

<sub>David Didau</sub>


The Course
----------

> Understand the route through training and education that is prepared for them, and their role in that training and education

From the [CCCU Computer Science Curriculm Guidance](https://learn.canterbury.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-2664627-dt-content-rid-3988355_1/xid-3988355_1)

> All sessions are designed to develop your pedagogy and have been devised by your University tutors in consultation with mentors from partnership schools that includes input from previous student teachers. 
> Sessions, underpinned by research and theory, will explore a wide range of teaching and learning strategies and resources and identify and make use of a variety of best practice ideologies.

The purpose of this course is to challenge you and challenge your thinking

### Aims and purposes of our teaching and learning

* Meta-pedagogy (not _tips for teaching_, not pre-prepared-lessons)
* Tacit knowledge transfer - e.g. Riding Bike, Learning to read
    * Can you write down the steps to ride a bike?
* 10,000 hours
    * How long have you spent driving? Why are you not a world class driver?
    * You're operating without reflection/feedback mechanisms

TASK: How would you teach someone to ride a bike?
120 seconds - Write down - the phases/notes
Describe verbally to group

Venn diagram of
* Subject Knowledge
* Pedagogical Knowledge
* Context Knowledge

> Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) conceptualises both the link and the distinction between knowing something for yourself and being able to enable others to know it.

### Your development phases

* Unconscious incompetence
* Concious incompetence
* Concious competence
* Unconscious competence

1. Early idealism
2. Personal survival
3. Dealing with difficulties
4. Hitting a plateau
5. Moving on

### Strands

1. Criticality
    * conflict - alternate view - sources of information
2. Creativity
    * Can we teach concepts of computing with playdough?
3. Inclusion
    * Catering for everybody (not just a subset of society)
4. Subject Knowledge
    * Passion and Skill

### Course Requirements

* Experience teaching 4 year groups
* In 2 Schools
* With 120 Days teaching

With Covid, some of these requirement may not be possible.
This comes down to assessment from your Mentors and your Subject Tutor.

### Assessment

* Teaching Portfolio (physical or digital)
    * Single document to print/reference/archive
    * Lesson plans
    * Lesson observations
    * Examples of pupil work
    * Reflections
* 2 Academic Assignments
    * Subject
    * Active Research + Presentation

### Subject Sessions

Post Covid - Blended Learning - Flipped Learning

Same Course -> New ways of delivery

* Blended learning
    * Traditional: All learning done in the same classroom with the same teacher
    * Blended: The deliberate planning for different methods of delivery
        * Async/Synchronous 
        * Rotating, rooms, labs, equipment, teachers
* Flipped learning
    * Traditional: Lower order knowlege skills in lessons. Higher order skills (like evaluating) done at home
    * Flipped: Lower order knowlege skills at home (async). Higher order evaluation/discussion (sync) in class

![Here's What's Wrong With Bloom's Taxonomy: A Deeper Learning Perspective](https://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/learning_deeply/Blooms%20graphic.png)
> The problem is that both versions present a false vision of learning. 
> Learning is not a hierarchy or a linear process. 
> This graphic gives the mistaken impression that these cognitive processes are discrete, that it's possible to perform one of these skills separately from others. 
> It also gives the mistaken impression that some of these skills are more difficult

![What, why, and how to implement a flipped classroom model](https://omerad.msu.edu/images/teaching/blooms_taxonomy.png)
> In traditional learning, lower level of learning such as remembering and understanding is happening in class, while students are usually left to work on activities that involve higher level of learning outside of classroom.
> However, in the flipped classroom model, learning is flipped. 
> As you can see from the pyramid, students can finish the lower level of cognitive work before class. And when they come to class, they can engage in higher cognitive levels of learning with peers and teacher present.

* 50% of Subject Sessions == On Campus - Face-to-face
    * 6 hours (+1 hour lunch) 9:00 to 16:00
* 50% of Subject Session == Online - Teams/BlackBoardCollaborate
    * Monday before a workshop
        * Sent 3 hours worth of async reading/videos/investigation
        * Collaboration with async tools - wikis, padlets
    * Friday (Subject Session Days)
        * AM - ad-hock space for 1-to-1 catchup with subject tutor
        * PM - 13:00 to 16:00 BlackBoardCollaborate/MSTeams

### Remote working/learning

#### The bad

* Not the same as face-to-face
* Lack of engagement
* Lack of socialisation and community
* How can you learn to teach if you cant see your students or be in a school?

TASK: What are you concerns?

#### Fall _Up_ (not down)

One Piece - Episode 119 - Secret of Powerful Swordplay!
> Zoro: (is heavily wounded)
>
> Mr1: My body is made of steel. I can turn any part of my body into a blade. You cannot win.
>
> Mr1: Why are you smiling?
>
> Zoro: Because when I finish this fight, I will be a man that can cut steel.

By the end of this year, we will have gained experience with a host of new tools that could have significant impact on our ability to teach more effectively. 

This could be one of the biggest evolutions in education for 100's of years.

### Ways of working (our group)

* How are we (as a group) going to embrace this remote learning?
* How are we going to ensure these session have impact and value for you?

Reflective practice
-------------------

(Model possible process)

* Actions (leaver)
    * Immediate actions
    * Future points (How will you come back to these?)
        * Behaviours? Cumulative?
* Measure impact (how will you know it has had an effect)
    * Cross-reference your actions

You need a note taking system.
Your note taking system should be online and transparent.

* Every subject session has progress, evidence and actions
    * You record
        * Action points
        * Reflections
    * My records
        * Comments on each student for each session
        * Monitor Engagement
            * If I was asked 'How is StudentX engaging with the subject sessions'. I could respond by pointing them at your action points and reflections for each session.
        * I could be asked to justify your progress
            * e.g last year when lockdown happened - educators asked to predict on trajectory
            * I will be part of a panel of professionals that could be asked about your progress


How we will reflect? Tooling
----------------------------

The other subjects will be looking at us technologists as beacons of good technology practice

* Screen Capture
    * [Snaggit](https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html) (paid)
        * YouTube unlisted
        * Onedrive, GoogleDrive, Dropbox
    * [Screencast-O-Matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/)
    * [screencastify](https://www.screencastify.com/)
        * Web based screen recorder
            * Download or post to YouTube

* [Markdown](../other/markdown.md)
    * It has semantic meaning
    * It can be version controlled
    * It can be converted as slides, html, pdf

* Possible Workflows
    * Text file and public DropBox folder
    * Google Sites
        * Invite others to collaborate in realtime
    * BlackBoard Wiki/Blog
    * GitHub + Markdown
        * [github.com/ComputingTeachers](https://github.com/ComputingTeachers)
            * Do you want full admin rights?

TASKS:
* Understand MarkDown
    * Create a file with 
        * 3 Levels of headings
        * Bullets/numbered lists
        * Links
        * Images
* Trial Screen Capture solutions
    * Be comfortable with recording and sharing 60 second
        * Segments of screens
        * Vlog entries
* Get a YouTube Account
    * Create + Upload an unlisted video and share it with the group
* Construct a workflow to share your action points and reflections with the group
    * Actions points should have dates
    * This should to be a cumulative record-keeping solution for the year

Feel free to skip tasks if you have mastered them. I will expect you to be able to perform these skills from this point onwards.

TASK: For SP3
Create a screen capture video that is less than 2min, demoing your reflection workflow
Requirements:
* Active/Current actions/tasks + Archived actions/tasks
* Class/Tutor must have access to some of your actions/reflections/resources
* This must be linked from the course blackboard wiki

Next session we will be consolidating as a group how we reflect and collaborate online.


### My Example Workflows
* My notebook method
* Plain textfile synced
* MarkDown (teaching knowlege-base - unfinished)


### Notes about tooling

* Do not suffer dataloss.
    * Use the right tools.
    * There will be little excuse for you as Computing professionals to loose data.
    * Dropbox, OneDrive, GoogleDrive, Google Docs, Microsoft Office 365

* Use Styles
    * If I ever see anyone changing the size of a font freehand in a document or slideshow, I will loose my ****!

### Online Sessions

Choice
* Blackboard
    * Breakout feature + polls
* MSTeams
    * Better adaptive streaming

Both can be recorded

### Recording Sessions

* ReCap
    * If we record a 7 hour video
        * This is hard to access/find/seek information
        * It discourages some people to participate because it will be set in stone
    * I will record segments of sessions
    * The _YouTube_ effect
        * We are all exposed to exceptionally high quality online videos
        * Pro video equipment, lighting, editing, scripting, info-graphics
    * In reality - it is hard to extract meaningful information from a video


Professionalism and conduct
---------------------------

> Identify and understand expectations regarding professionalism and professionality

### Discuss

> Teachers are pillars of society

<sub>Anon</sub>

See my Session on [_firstProfetionalRole.md](./_firstProfetionalRole.md)

### Recommendations

* Be punctual
* Do not discuss politics or religion with school colleagues
* Be 100% yourself, but watch your terminology/language
* Be mindful of ongoing negativity
    * when relaying problems - suggest solutions
    * identify/call-out good progress

### My Role as course tutor (the reality)
* Line manager-esk?
* Every interaction is an assessment
* I will keep records
    * Engagement
    * Language/demeanour
    * Punctuality
    * Contributions

Some of you may have had a drink in a pub with your line manager at the end of the week. You can be friends. But they are still your line manager. They have the power to invoke disciplinary procedures and formally report progress.

As a result of my role, you need to construct your interactions with me deliberately.

You need to construct the interactions with your mentors deliberately

### University Communication

* Complaints in the past that communication has been fragmented, late or mistimed
* Lots of moving parts
    * Tutor, School Mentor, Uni Admin, Uni Program Directors, Students, School Admin, PGCE-topup Tutor
* I am not on the same email lists as you (This is being discussed/rectified)
* If the communication is less then ideal ...
    * Do not panic
    * Communicate concerns clearly
    * You will not be penalised unduely or unfairly


Emotional Health 
----------------

(terminology; not mental health)

Peers important support
Informal whatssapp group
Without me

You want to know that someone cares about you and your progress

Friday morning (on online days) - 1 to 1 catchup sessions

Express concern in a professional problem solving context

TASK: Setup an informal communications channel
* separate from the uni systems
* It is important that I am not part of this external group
* ideas: whatsapp? discord? You decide/discuss the technology

NOW: Group email with all members of the group


Computer Science
----------------

### What is Computer Science?

3 strands: Computing, Information Communication Technology, [Digital Literacy](./digitalLiteracy.md)

TASK: 
* What's the difference between Computing and ICT?
* Why have we switched focus from ICT to Computing?

### What are the expectations/misconceptions teaching Computer Science?

* "Young people are so good. All that clicking around so fast"
* I'm not going to be a software developer this is pointless

* Actually work with data
* as

More
* Perceptions of gender and ethnicity in Computing

### Explore the backlash and confusion about computer science in education and wider society

TASK: Background reading

Why our subject has friction with society

Computing in the curriculum has been criticized for not being relevant for all students.

> "Pedagogy does not often survive contact with the classroom" (Lynch, 2013, p. xv).
> Lynch suggests learning to teach must be a combination of views about teaching that candidates bring to programs along with experience.
> Lynch calls this the Tuesday morning question:
> What will teachers do after they have had the experience of Monday?
> He asserts that
> learning from experience is possible through theories of pedagogy,
> but pedagogy without experience is meaningless

> How can programs prepare candidates for complex teaching situations that may not match coursework exactly? 
> Learning to teach literacy is not simply learning content, skills, and strategies, 
> but a way to think about teaching as a flexible, adaptive process 
> that takes into account district requirements, school culture, teacher expertise, curricular demands, and students’ needs.
> Teachers need to make professional judgements during teaching, 
> and perhaps even become subversive in adaptations, depending on their teaching contexts.
>
> This begins in coursework where teacher educators should help candidates understand when, where, and how to be advocates for a different stance. 
> Indeed, we are not advocates of replicating program instructors or a “Clone Army” (McCallum & Lucas, 2002) of teachers who compliantly do as they are told.
