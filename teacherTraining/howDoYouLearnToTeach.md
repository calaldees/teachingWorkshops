How do you learn to teach
=========================

* Aims and purposes of our teaching and learning
* Meta-pedagogy (not _tips for teaching_)
* Tacit knowledge transfer - e.g. Riding Bike, Learning to read
* Reflection

Aims of Subject Pedagogy
------------------------

* What is Subject Pedagogy?
* You already have foundation subject knowledge
* We are learning HOW to teach someone about Computing
* I will not be showing you tips for teaching
* I will not give you resources
* I don't know the 'right' way to teach. Nobody does. It's contextual.
* Training _you_ as teachers to _reinvent the profession_ (and not be cones of us teacher trainers)
* Preparing students for a future we are unsure of
    * spellcheck story


Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK)
-----------------------------------

Venn diagram of
* Subject Knowledge
* Pedagogical Knowledge
* Context Knowledge

> Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) conceptualises both the link and the distinction between knowing something for yourself and being able to enable others to know it.
<sub>Shulman</sub>

Imagine if I started talking to you and as long as I kept talking, then by the time I stopped talking you would would know everything about computing that I do. Simple right!
We need PCK.

Tacit Knowledge
---------------

* [Tacit Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge)
    * Tacit knowledge is knowledge that cannot be captured through words alone.
    * tacit knowledge feel like _a hunch_ - feels right. it enabled creative problem solving
    * Some people argue that tacit knowledge does not exist - everything can be quantified and deliberately taught



* Tacit knowledge transfer - e.g. Riding Bike, Learning to read
    * Can you write down the steps to ride a bike?

TASK: How would you teach someone to ride a bike?
120 seconds - Write down - the phases/notes
Describe verbally to group


* We don't get better by just doing a task for 10,000 hours
    * How long have you spent driving? Why are you not a world class driver?
    * You're operating without reflection/feedback mechanisms
* we get better by observation, analysis, feedback, mentoring

We don't really know much about education
-----------------------------------------

* [The Biggest Myth In Education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhgwIhB58PA) veretasium 2021 - learning styles YouYube 15min
    * you are not a visual learner
    * be critical

* [What are we doing? Are we all doing it?](https://bennewmark.wordpress.com/2021/06/22/what-are-we-doing-are-we-all-doing-it/) 5min
    * Lesson observations are not sufficient for knowing is teaching is effective
    * Observers look for a focused environment where student know what they are doing
    * This is a poor proxy for "learning", but it is an effective proxy
    * Necessary but _not sufficient_, but very necessary.

* So much of what we know about education is incomplete and possibly wrong
* Education is a new thing; We've only been sitting at desks for 100 years. Before that EVERYTHING was apprenticeships



Reflective practice
===================

* Up until now, (level 6 and below) you have been _taught at_. You've been told what to learn and how to learn it.
* At postgraduate level - there are 'no answers'.
* We have take information from a range of sources and structure our thinking in a particular way that allows us to critically inspect and challenges our beliefs/assumptions

"I'm just going to think lots and get better" - not that simple

Criticality and learning to think
---------------------------------

* Metaphor "routing around in the grass"
    * Snake in the grass?
    * evolution makes us not hang around to find out
    * We know!! The risk/cost of investigating is too high
    * When we are certain - we don't think
    * "routing around in the grass" to find out is dangerous
    * Modern society (mostly) is not instant death.
    * If we even see people routing around in the grass we tut and sigh and roll our eye's. We feel like we know the answer.
    * Don't stop others for routing around in the grass. Start digging yourself.

* Duck or rabbit?

        * Which is it?



* We are debating over interpretation. It is not either, it's just some lines

Pedagogy and Practice
---------------------

[Are We Preparing or Training Teachers? Developing Professional Judgement in and Beyond Teacher Preparation Programs](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022487117702584) [padlet](https://padlet-uploads.storage.googleapis.com/620776567/c1f78b95d4d4ba6b8911b4ea271a0184/Are_we_preparing_or_training_teachers.pdf) Scales 2018

> "Pedagogy does not often survive contact with the classroom" (Lynch, 2013, p. xv).
> Lynch suggests learning to teach must be a combination of views about teaching that candidates bring to programs along with experience.
> Lynch calls this the Tuesday morning question:
> What will teachers do after they have had the experience of Monday?
> He asserts that
> learning from experience is possible through theories of pedagogy,
> but pedagogy without experience is meaningless

> How can programs prepare candidates for complex teaching situations that may not match coursework exactly? 
> Learning to teach literacy is not simply learning content, skills, and strategies, 
> but a way to think about teaching as a flexible, adaptive process 
> that takes into account district requirements, school culture, teacher expertise, curricular demands, and students’ needs.
> Teachers need to make professional judgements during teaching, 
> and perhaps even become subversive in adaptations, depending on their teaching contexts.
>
> This begins in coursework where teacher educators should help candidates understand when, where, and how to be advocates for a different stance.
> Indeed, we are not advocates of replicating program instructors or a “Clone Army” (McCallum & Lucas, 2002) of teachers who compliantly do as they are told.


Research informed Practice
--------------------------

Even if you've taught full time for 3 years.
How many young people have you taught? Maybe 1000? for a few hours each ... maybe some of them 60 hours in a year.
How many young people are in the country? the world? how many other techniques do you think there are?
Even with 3 years of battle experience, without research and scholarship you have no idea how your ideals compare to the planet.


Stop working on hunches and things that feel right.
Remember "poor proxies for learning", just because they are quiet, does not mean that leaning is happening.
So we combine "Practice with Scholarship"


* [Teaching and Learning Toolkit](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/education-evidence/teaching-learning-toolkit) - An accessible summary of education evidence

DISCUSSION: Is the EEF the final word on this? Is there more to the story? Criticality (more on this tuesday)?


Public Blog Concept?
-------------------

* To enhance your reflections this year you could have them publicly visible and blog about your experiences and growth.
* This could be too much for some

* [Blogging while on professional placement: explaining the diversity in student attitudes and engagement](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1475939X.2013.847481?journalCode=rtpe20) Dalgarno (2013)
    * > The use of journals by students while on placement is a well-accepted strategy for encouraging reflection on practice, with the use of online blogs for this purpose potentially providing additional benefits through shared reflection and peer support. The aim of this study was to explore the effectiveness of an online blogging activity by teacher education students while on professional placement in schools.

    * > conceptualise the participation issue central to blogs through examining the factors that hinder student teachers from writing academic blogs and exchanging comments


My technique/approach to Student teacher reflections
----------------------------------------------------

* Students have limited time. The activity has to feel worthwhile.
* Students don't want to show others their "incorrect and floundering" inner monologue and scribbles
    * But without an audience/viewer they see little point in doing it
* Student feel threatened when big scary tutor demands to see their reflections. It's too much like marking and judgment.

So!

* At the beginning of every subject session. We will spend 15min to 30min showing another member of the group your weekly mentor sheet and talking about the targets and reflections.
    * Pair up with different people each week (I hopefully don't need to define a rota)
    * I may circulate and pop into some of the discussions
* Your reflections/action points from subject sessions will also go on the weekly mentor meeting sheet.
* Your targets on your weekly mentor meeting sheet are your _leavers_

* One document. One place. Consistent "judgment free" low stakes discussion.
