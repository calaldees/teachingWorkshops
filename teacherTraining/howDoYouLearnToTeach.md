Introductions
-------------

### Who am I?

My background
* 7 years teaching ICT and Computing in secondary schools - Practical battle experience
* 10 years as a senior developer in central London across a range of domains
* (2 years sessions) + 1 year formally as Lecturer in Education.
* My weakness is _cutting edge research_ and _teaching theory_
    * I will constantly working towards this the rest of my career

I have my own ideas about how to teach computing
* Multiple languages at once
* Freedom (self direct-ish)/project based/Creativity (removal of hierarchy)
* Unit tests, Pair programming (talking about code and collaborating), Version control
But this course is not about my _opinions_ or about my preferred teaching methods.
You must develop your own critically to develop your own subject pedagogy knowledge.

### Who are you?

TASK: 120 second summary
* Rough background (education, work)
* Course: PGCE, 7-14 or SchoolDirect?
* What are you exited about this year
* What are you fearful about this year (we are all vulnerable)

<sub>side-note: Computing teachers mindsets - tech workers? - be mindful - other subject practitioners can feel trapped in the profession</sub>

The burden of learning to teach - the _expert beginner_
Primary->Secondary->Uni->Carear1Employment1->Carear2Employment2->Retraining->Carear2Employment1





### Lighthouse statement

You've made a lighthouse statement about _who you are_ and _why you want to teach_.
I made a lighthouse statement at the start of my teacher training PGCE.
I read it back at the end of my PGCE year.
I could not identify with it.
It was some words that babaled about _making a difference_. It was unstructured idealist nonsense.
I could not believe how much the year had changed me.

This year will change you.

This is a wonderful example of
> When you learn something, you are permanently changed.
<sub>David Didau</sub>

#### You will outgrow my support
Right now I might look to you like some super-human teaching deity. By the end of this course you will feel completely differently. I'm just some dude doing a job I like. By the end of this year you will have outgrown the support I can give you. At the celebration day at the end of the course we will just be a bunch of people sitting around and talking about education.



Meta-pedagogy (not _tips for teaching_)
-------------
What is Subject Pedagogy?
You already have foundation subject knowledge.
We are learning HOW to teach someone about Computing.
I will not be showing you tips for teaching. 
I will not give you resources.

Your students are NOT you
--------------------------

* Your students are NOT you - stop using yourself as a benchmark
    * How you learned
    * your interests are not their interests "learn by making games; Who doesn't like games"
    * What % of your students will get a degree in Computing?

Allocate reps?

Placement 1: CTP + DTP
Placement 2: ITP


### Be open?

* [They are not the baddies](https://teachreal.wordpress.com/2021/09/11/they-are-not-the-baddies/)
    * A youthful perception of school is not always accurate (even adults remembering)
    * Don't jump to conclusions about rules being setup
    * schools (and their employees) are the baddies

* Blended learning
    * Traditional: All learning done in the same classroom with the same teacher
    * Blended: The deliberate planning for different methods of delivery
        * Async/Synchronous 
        * Rotating, rooms, labs, equipment, teachers
* Flipped learning
    * Traditional: Lower order knowledge skills in lessons. Higher order skills (like evaluating) done at home
    * Flipped: Lower order knowledge skills at home (async). Higher order evaluation/discussion (sync) in class

![Here's What's Wrong With Bloom's Taxonomy: A Deeper Learning Perspective](https://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/learning_deeply/Blooms%20graphic.png)
> The problem is that both versions present a false vision of learning. 
> Learning is not a hierarchy or a linear process. 
> This graphic gives the mistaken impression that these cognitive processes are discrete, that it's possible to perform one of these skills separately from others. 
> It also gives the mistaken impression that some of these skills are more difficult

![What, why, and how to implement a flipped classroom model](https://omerad.msu.edu/images/teaching/blooms_taxonomy.png)
> In traditional learning, lower level of learning such as remembering and understanding is happening in class, while students are usually left to work on activities that involve higher level of learning outside of classroom.
> However, in the flipped classroom model, learning is flipped. 
> As you can see from the pyramid, students can finish the lower level of cognitive work before class. And when they come to class, they can engage in higher cognitive levels of learning with peers and teacher present.

### Remote working/learning

#### The bad

* Not the same as face-to-face
* Lack of engagement
* Lack of socialisation and community
* How can you learn to teach if you cant see your students or be in a school?

TASK: What are you concerns?

#### Fall _Up_ (not down)

One Piece - Episode 119 - Secret of Powerful Swordplay!
> Zoro: (is heavily wounded)
>
> Mr1: My body is made of steel. I can turn any part of my body into a blade. You cannot win.
>
> Mr1: Why are you smiling?
>
> Zoro: Because when I finish this fight, I will be a man that can cut steel.

By the end of this year, we will have gained experience with a host of new tools that could have significant impact on our ability to teach more effectively. 

This could be one of the biggest evolutions in education for 100's of years.

### Ways of working (our group)

* How are we (as a group) going to embrace this remote learning?
* How are we going to ensure these session have impact and value for you?
