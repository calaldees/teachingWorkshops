    * encourage students to become more active in their learning, 
    * make the CS classroom more authentic, more similar to the real work setting of CS practitioners
    * build on students' existing knowledge and understanding
    * encourage peer learning in various ways. In all papers, ICT is used to leverage these efforts.
    * > bring about a transformation in the students' professional point of view: Helping them become competent and appreciative of what CS professionals deem as problems worth solving, acceptable work process, elegant and effective solutions, knowledge worth knowing, and so forth
    * “Experiences with lab-centric instruction”, Titterton, Lewis, and Clancy
        * > substituting lecture for lab time
    * Teaching computer science through problems, not solutions”, Fee and Holland-Minkley propose a problem-based learning
    * Constructive evaluation: a pedagogy of student-contributed assessment”, Luxton-Reilly and Denny
        * > “constructive evaluation”. Students are required to author questions that assess one or more of the learning outcomes of a course and provide a sample solution

* Example Course
    * Weeks 1 to 2
        * Individual choice from a range of work provided by the teacher. Student self-assessment using materials provided
    * Weeks 3 to 6
        * Children construct own problems like those in weeks 1 and 2 and select structured math apparatus to aid solutions
    * Weeks 7 to 10
        * Children presented with a new learning objectives, and make up their own problems, without exemplars by the teacher
    * Weeks 11 to 14
        * Children set their own learning objectives, construct appropriate problems, and use appropriate self-assessment
    * Weeks 15 to 20
        * As weeks 1 to 14, but with less monitoring from the teacher and increased freedom of choice and personal responsibility

How do we train groups to interact?
> We are all better at spotting mistakes in the work of others.
