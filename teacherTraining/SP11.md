Subject Pedagogy Assignment 2
-----------------------------

* > You may use the proforma provided to help you to structure your reflections of at least two critical incidents that 
have occurred during your teaching practice,  using the first phase of Tripp’s diagnostic teaching cycle. You should 
use key theoretical frameworks to help you to understand your practice.
* > Building on the literature you have used to reflect on your practice, you should present *one* of these incidents
thinking diagnostically/critically about what happened and why, and how you can improve teaching and learning.
* Re-reading the brief, it says 'AT LEAST TWO' and 'ONE'. The answer is *one* with sufficient depth and reference to literature.
* Where possible, include subject specific nature rather than just sticking to generic teaching.

* [Innovative teaching in computer science: what does it mean and why do we need it?](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08993408.2010.486239) 2010 Y. Ben-David Kolikant 
    * encourage students to become more active in their learning, 
    * make the CS classroom more authentic, more similar to the real work setting of CS practitioners
    * build on students' existing knowledge and understanding
    * encourage peer learning in various ways. In all papers, ICT is used to leverage these efforts.
    * > bring about a transformation in the students' professional point of view: Helping them become competent and appreciative of what CS professionals deem as problems worth solving, acceptable work process, elegant and effective solutions, knowledge worth knowing, and so forth
    * “Experiences with lab-centric instruction”, Titterton, Lewis, and Clancy
        * > substituting lecture for lab time
    * Teaching computer science through problems, not solutions”, Fee and Holland-Minkley propose a problem-based learning
    * Constructive evaluation: a pedagogy of student-contributed assessment”, Luxton-Reilly and Denny
        * > “constructive evaluation”. Students are required to author questions that assess one or more of the learning outcomes of a course and provide a sample solution
            * How can this be organised? My students can't formulate questions or consolidate their knowledge effectively in words
