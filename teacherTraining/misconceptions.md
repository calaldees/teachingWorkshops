Copy&Paste from article above - the list is amazing!

Variables

    writing code for statements like ‘x is equal to 3 or 4’ literally as ‘x == 3 or 4’ which causes headaches if using a language where the expression to the right of the Boolean operator has a Boolean interpretation.
    Value and variable are often swapped too eg 7 = x.
    the perennial problem of confusing assignment (=) with a test for equality (==). x=x+1 is utterly confusing in the mathematical terms children are familiar with.
    foo="A"
    bar="B"
    foo=bar
    //gives foo="B" and bar="B"
    Slicing a string removes characters from the original string.
    Lists and arrays are the same thing.
    Variables remain linked after assignment. a := 7; b := a; a := 13; What’s the value of b? Students with this misconception would answer 13. (This might be worse in languages that use an equals sign for assignment. After all, b = a seems to suggest these semantics…)
    Inverted assignment (first = second) - wrong way round

Logic

    thinking the inverse of x < y is x > y.
    Loops, functions, variables, classes don’t really exist. CPUs have no clue about any of these things, they exist only in the language translator and debuging.

Flow Control
Sequence

    ‘sequence’ in Maths meaning a pattern and ‘sequence’ in Computing meaning an order
    Every line in Java / C / C# / C++ must have a semi colon at the end of it.
    if x == y: (execute then part even if false)

Selection

    ELSE in selection needs a Boolean test of its own
    ELSE is always needed in a selection statement
    1=="1" is True (not helped by the fact in some languages it is!)
    IF(A > 6 AND < 8) instead of IF(A > 6 AND A < 8)
    Language dependent IF (A = B) is the same as IF (A == B)
    Students insist on using: If test=True Then, rather than: If test Then

Repetition

    where the student thinks that the loop break when ever the condition stops being true, rather than at the boundary where it is checked.
    loops always exit from the bottom of the loop instead of where the loop control condition is evaluated.

Subprograms

    Confusing a function call with a GOTO (this is terrible because it often kind of works with a few weird side effects)
    Returning False from function even though condition does not hold
    All subprograms must have a return statement
    not storing return value of function
    mixing up the direction in which data flows between subprograms that ask for user input or carry out some output. Data from the user should go out from the subprogram to the rest of the program not in. Data to the user should go in to the subprogram not out of it.
    Lots of my students (despite careful teaching to the contrary…) confuse a function returning a value with a procedure that outputs (i.e. prints) a value.

Data Representation

    The length of a string is the number of chars in it, but string indexing is zero based. The length of CAT is 3, but the T is at index 2. (Some languages have settable origin 0 or 1)
    Assuming that all two’s complement numbers are going to be negative.
    assuming all hexadecimal numbers MUST have letters

Technology

    That the best way to type a capital letter is the Caps Lock key :/
    Clock speed More cycles per second doesn’t automatically mean faster. Some CPUs do more in each clock cycle, or memory may not be able to keep up.
    USB == Memory Stick
    Input devices being something you put into the computer (i.e. anything that you can plug in, especially power).

Networking

    pupils learn about a logical star network topology and assume this is how it is physically configured (i.e. a server sits in the middle and all nodes are directly connected to it).
    Peer-to-peer networks are believed to be a network topology, rather than a virtual network implemented at software layers
    WiFi connects you directly to the Internet…
    …and this connection is available anywhere you go.
    The class of an IP address dictates the subnet mask that must be used.
    servers are big computers
    Absolute misunderstanding of what Wifi is altogether, using it as a general term for their router at home.

Web

    The title tag in HTML produces a title on the webpage itself.
    The HTML head element describes what appears at the top of a webpage.
    Conflating the Internet and World Wide Web.
    Confusing Web browser and search engine. Google being a browser
    Referring to HTML as a programming language/writing a program.

Spreadsheet

    SUM in a spreadsheet means ‘add’ (as in maths) not ‘do a calculation’ [also =SUM(A1+A2) is a pet hate!]
    =SUM() being needed for any calculation in Excel.

Computer Systems

    Processor cores execute multiple instructions at the same time (multitasking).
    Having more processor cores directly improves the runtime of a (single threaded) application
    Logic gates are discrete components not made of anything else (no knowledge of transistors)

Other

    Compilers produce assembly code which is then converted to machine code.
    Detecting errors is the same as correcting errors.


---

Parameter variable names and postion - students don't understand they do not need to match
e.g.
```python
def thing(c, d):  # These do not have be called `i` and `j`
    print(f'{d}-{c}')
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        thing(i, j)
```

are the charcaters you type the same as copy and paste?

Inverted assignment
Wrong branch
exeution function insted of defining it

mismatched brackets
Wrong type of brackets
Cannot comprehend 'indentation' of blocks ... just can't .. can't even follow instructions. Simply does not understand what is even being said, or why it is being said.

if and else-if
score = 77
if score > 70:
  you rock
if score > 50
  you did ok .. I guess
if score < 40
  you fail

Case of strings
Brackets MUST match

= and == not nearly as common as teachers believed

Compiler error pointing to 'misdirecting line' (it's actually caused by a problem a few lines up)

Mass copy paste without understanding context (removing main method). Simply does not know enough about language to access the resources.
