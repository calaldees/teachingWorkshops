Pre-Reading
-----------

* [SEND code of practice: 0 to 25 years](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25)
    * Read Section 6 _School_ pg91 to pg 110
        * Make notes on
            * What are your responsibilities as a subject teacher?
            * A list of skills/training-needs you think you need to develop (You will use this list when your mentor meetings)
            * What are the 4 broad areas of need - can you identify any traits/names to these areas?
* [Cognitive Abilities Test (CAT) Guidance: TEACHER GUIDANCE](https://www.gl-assessment.co.uk/media/352577/29759-cat4-uk-combined-v10.pdf)
    * Read the _What is CAT4?_ pg7 to pg16
    * Read _What CAT4 tells you_ pg112 to pg 118
    * Make notes on
        * What are the different buckets of questions?
        * What are the buckets for?
        * What is a good CAT score? what is a weak CAT score?
* Compare prepared to consider how we can adapt our Computing teaching to be inclusive to all learners.
    * Consider ITT CCF 5.4. 
        * > Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils.

ITT CCF
-------

* Adaptive Teaching (Standard 5–‘Adapt teaching’)
    * Learn That
        1. Pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed
        3. Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success
        4. Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils
        7. Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential
    * Learn How to
        * Identifying pupils who need new content further broken down.
* Professional Behaviours (Standard 8–‘Fulfil wider professional responsibilities’)
    4. Building effective relationships with parents, carers and families can improve pupils’ motivation, behaviour and academic success
    5. Teaching assistants (TAs) can support pupils more effectively when they are prepared for lessons by teachers, and when TAs supplement rather than replace support from teachers.
    6. SENCOs, pastoral leaders, careers advisors and other specialist colleagues also have valuable expertise and can ensure that appropriate support is in place for pupils


SEND code of practice
---------------------

* [SEND code of practice: 0 to 25 years](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25)

TASK 1: (15min)
* What are your responsibilities as a subject teacher?
    * Google Doc
* A list of skills/training-needs you think you need to develop (You will use this list when your mentor meetings)

TASK 2: (15min)
PartA:
* What are the 4 broad areas of need - can you identify any traits/names to these areas?
PartB (15min - could be extended ...)
* What could we do in a Computing classroom to facilitate each of these possible traits/areas of need?
    * Would love to hear your personal experiences and contributions

Some of my closing remarks
* Many of the special schools have been closed - a wider spectrum of students are expected to attant mainstream education.
* Every teacher is a teacher of SEN and disabilities - we do not delegate to other teachers - we ARE the support
* We are an inclusive society


Inclusive Society?
------------------

Discussion:
You have read that as teachers we are duty-bound to include all students of all possible ability's, backgrounds, races, genders, disabilities, ethnicity's, etc.
We are an inclusive society.

TASK: (15min)
With that in mind ... carefully discuss as a group the role of
* Single sex schools
* Grammar schools
* Special schools (do you as a teacher have the skills/training to support all of the required needs?)


EEF: Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools
----------------------------------------------------

* [EEF: Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/tools/guidance-reports/special-educational-needs-disabilities/)
    * Create a positive and supportive environment for all pupils without exception
        * Build trust in you/teacher - we really want the best for them and there is no judgement
    * Build an ongoing, holistic understanding of your pupils and their needs
        * Assessment should be regular and purposeful rather than a one-off event, 
        * seek input from parents/carers as well as the pupil themselves ...
    * Ensure all pupils have access to high quality teaching
        * flexible grouping;
        * cognitive and metacognitive strategies;
        * explicit instruction;
        * using technology
    * Complement high quality teaching with carefully selected small-group and one-to-one interventions
    * Work effectively with teaching assistants

Case Study: (slightly close to home) C# Undergrads
Same course - personalised support


Accessibility
-------------

As teachers we will create digital content and put this on VLE's (Virtual Learning Environments).
We need to adhere to government requirements

TASK: Skim read (10min) - As a group - relay anything that we as teachers need to consider about out content?
* [Understanding Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - WCAG 2.1](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag)

* Paragraphs and dense text
    * I struggle with lots of words
    * Young people struggle with lots of words
    * Use less words

        * When presenting remove redundant words. "So", "Basically", "Just" (See my blog post on presenting)

TASK: Copy/Paste some text you have written (maybe one of your reflections?) into hemingwayapp.com


Inclusion Concept: Vertical Tutoring?
-------------------------------------

* Experiments have been done in schools to break traditional year groups.
* Form time includes small community's of students from all years.
* Research shows that facilitating peer mentoring creates improvements
    * [Peer tutoring](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evidence-summaries/teaching-learning-toolkit/peer-tutoring/)
        * cross-age tutoring, in which an older learner takes the tutoring role and is paired with a younger tutee or tutees;

* Special year 9 student and rewards trip problems with parents

Lesson Planning
---------------

* Every lesson I relay to students on the board
    * All - of you will
    * Most - of you should
    * Some - of you could
    * (How will you as a teacher know this? you should make a note of % for each of these categories - maybe even some names)
* Reality
    * Plan for 10% absence from every session
    * Explicitly describe in your lesson plan 'What you will do for students that missed last session' (even name them in your plan?)
* Plan for TA

### Differentiation

* [Computing in the curriculum: Challenges and strategies from a teacher’s perspective](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-016-9482-0) 2016 Sue Sentance and Andrew Csizmadia

    * 2nd biggest teacher concern for teaching Computing - Differentiation - to meet different levels of ability
        * 1st was own subject knowlege

The gap between students can become huge very quickly ...

* ITT CCF 5.4.

        > They must change and adapt to fit the circumstances and their environment such as attending university.
* Social model of disability -> person needs support -> low-income, negative attitudes, badly designed buildings
* > your responsibility to ensure that your learning and teaching activities and materials are accessible.

Appendix
========

* [SEND code of practice: 0 to 25 years](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25)
    * 1.24
        * High quality teaching that is differentiated and personalised will meet the individual needs of the majority of children and young people.
        * Some children and young people need educational provision that is additional to or different from this.
        * This is special educational provision under Section 21 of the Children and Families Act 2014.
        * Schools and colleges must use their best endeavours to ensure that such provision is made for those who need it.
        * Special educational provision is underpinned by high quality teaching and is compromised by anything less.
    * 1.26
        * As part of its commitments under articles 7 and 24 of the United Nations Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the UK Government is committed to inclusive education of disabled children and young people and the progressive removal of barriers to learning and participation in mainstream education.
    * Section 6: pg91 to pg110
    * 6.2
        * ensure that children and young people with SEN engage in the activities of the school alongside pupils who do not have SEN
        * The quality of teaching for pupils with SEN, and the progress made by pupils, should be a core part of the school’s performance management arrangements and its approach to professional development for all teaching and support staff. School leaders and teaching staff, including the SENCO, should identify any patterns in the identification of SEN
        * The identification of SEN should be built into the overall approach to monitoring the progress and development of all pupils
    * 6.12
        * All pupils should have access to a broad and balanced curriculum. 
        * The National Curriculum Inclusion Statement states that teachers should set high expectations for every pupil, whatever their prior attainment. 
        * Teachers should use appropriate assessment to set targets which are deliberately ambitious. 
        * Potential areas of difficulty should be identified and addressed at the outset. 
        * Lessons should be planned to address potential areas of difficulty and to remove barriers to pupil achievement. 
        * In many cases, such planning will mean that pupils with SEN and disabilities will be able to study the full national curriculum.
    * 6.16
        * Schools should assess each pupil’s current skills and levels of attainment on entry, building on information from previous settings and key stages where appropriate
    * 6.17
        * Class and subject teachers, supported by the senior leadership team, should make regular assessments of progress for all pupils. 
        * These should seek to identify pupils making less than expected progress given their age and individual circumstances
    * 6.18
        * It can include progress in areas other than attainment – for instance where a pupil needs to make additional progress with wider development or social needs in order to make a successful transition to adult life
    * 6.19
        * The first response to such progress should be high quality teaching targeted at their areas of weakness.
        * Where progress continues to be less than expected the class or subject teacher, working with the SENCO, should assess whether the child has SEN
    * 6.21
        * Persistent disruptive or withdrawn behaviours do not necessarily mean that a child or young person has SEN. Where there are concerns, there should be an assessment to determine whether there are any causal factors such as undiagnosed learning difficulties, difficulties with communication or mental health issues. 
        * If it is thought housing, family or other domestic circumstances may be contributing to the presenting behaviour a multi-agency approach
    * 6.22
        * Professionals should also be alert to other events that can lead to learning difficulties or wider mental health difficulties, such as bullying or bereavement.
        * Such events will not always lead to children having SEN but it can have an impact on wellbeing and sometimes this can be severe.
        * Schools should ensure they make appropriate provision for a child’s short-term needs in order to prevent problems escalating.
    * 6.23
        * Slow progress and low attainment do not necessarily mean that a child has SEN and should not automatically lead to a pupil being recorded as having SEN. 
        * However, they may be an indicator of a range of learning difficulties or disabilities.
        * Equally, it should not be assumed that attainment in line with chronological age means that there is no learning difficulty or disability.
        * Some learning difficulties and disabilities occur across the range of cognitive ability and, left unaddressed may lead to frustration, which may manifest itself as disaffection, emotional or behavioural difficulties.
    * 6.24
        * Identifying and assessing SEN for children or young people whose first language is not English requires particular care
    * (6.28 -> 6.35) 4 areas of need
        * Communication / Interaction (6.28, 6.29)
            * Speech Language
            * Autism

            * Visual
            * Hearing
            * Physical
    * 6.37
        * High quality teaching, differentiated for individual pupils, is the first step in responding to pupils who have or may have SEN.
        * Additional intervention and support cannot compensate for a lack of good quality teaching. 
        * Schools should regularly and carefully review the quality of teaching for all pupils, including those at risk of underachievement.
        * This includes reviewing and, where necessary, improving,teachers’ understanding of strategies to identify and support vulnerable pupils and their knowledge of the SEN most frequently encountered
    * 6.45 Assess
        * ... subject teacher, working with the SENCO, should carry out a clear analysis of the pupil’s needs.
        * This should draw on the teacher’s assessment and experience of the pupil, their previous progress and attainment, as well as information from the school’s core approach to pupil progress, attainment, and behaviour.
        * It should also draw on other subject teachers’ assessments where relevant, the individual’s development in comparison to their peers and national data, the views and experience of parents, the pupil’s own views and, if relevant, advice from external support services.
        * Schools should take seriously any concerns raised by a parent.
        * These should be recorded and compared to the setting’s own assessment and information on how the pupil is developing.
    * 6.49 Plan
        * All teachers and support staff who work with the pupil should be made aware of their needs, the outcomes sought, the support provided and any teaching strategies or approaches that are required. This should also be recorded on the school’s information system.
    * 6.52 Do
        * subject teacher should remain responsible for working with the child on a daily basis. Where the interventions involve group or one-to-one teaching away from the main class or subject teacher, they should still retain responsibility for the pupil.
    * 6.54 Review
