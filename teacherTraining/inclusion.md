Pre-Reading
-----------

* [SEND code of practice: 0 to 25 years](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25)
    * Read Section 6 _School_ pg91 to pg 110
        * Make notes on
            * What are your responsibilities as a subject teacher?
            * A list of skills/training-needs you think you need to develop (You will use this list when your mentor meetings)
            * What are the 4 broad areas of need - can you identify any traits/names to these areas?
* [Cognitive Abilities Test (CAT) Guidance: TEACHER GUIDANCE](https://www.gl-assessment.co.uk/media/352577/29759-cat4-uk-combined-v10.pdf)
    * Read the _What is CAT4?_ pg7 to pg16
    * Read _What CAT4 tells you_ pg112 to pg 118
    * Make notes on
        * What are the different buckets of questions?
        * What are the buckets for?
        * What is a good CAT score? what is a weak CAT score?
* Compare prepared to consider how we can adapt our Computing teaching to be inclusive to all learners.
    * Consider ITT CCF 5.4. 
        * > Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils.

ITT CCF
-------

* Adaptive Teaching (Standard 5–‘Adapt teaching’)
    * Learn That
        1. Pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed
        3. Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success
        4. Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils
        7. Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential
    * Learn How to
        * Identifying pupils who need new content further broken down.
* Professional Behaviours (Standard 8–‘Fulfil wider professional responsibilities’)
    4. Building effective relationships with parents, carers and families can improve pupils’ motivation, behaviour and academic success
    5. Teaching assistants (TAs) can support pupils more effectively when they are prepared for lessons by teachers, and when TAs supplement rather than replace support from teachers.
    6. SENCOs, pastoral leaders, careers advisors and other specialist colleagues also have valuable expertise and can ensure that appropriate support is in place for pupils


SEND code of practice
---------------------

* [SEND code of practice: 0 to 25 years](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25)

TASK 1: (15min)
* What are your responsibilities as a subject teacher?
    * Google Doc
* A list of skills/training-needs you think you need to develop (You will use this list when your mentor meetings)

TASK 2: (15min)
PartA:
* What are the 4 broad areas of need - can you identify any traits/names to these areas?
PartB (15min - could be extended ...)
* What could we do in a Computing classroom to facilitate each of these possible traits/areas of need?
    * Would love to hear your personal experiences and contributions

Some of my closing remarks
* Many of the special schools have been closed - a wider spectrum of students are expected to attant mainstream education.
* Every teacher is a teacher of SEN and disabilities - we do not delegate to other teachers - we ARE the support
* We are an inclusive society


Inclusive Society?
------------------

Discussion:
You have read that as teachers we are duty-bound to include all students of all possible ability's, backgrounds, races, genders, disabilities, ethnicity's, etc.
We are an inclusive society.

TASK: (15min)
With that in mind ... carefully discuss as a group the role of
* Single sex schools
* Grammar schools
* Special schools (do you as a teacher have the skills/training to support all of the required needs?)


EEF: Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools
----------------------------------------------------

* [EEF: Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/tools/guidance-reports/special-educational-needs-disabilities/)
    * Create a positive and supportive environment for all pupils without exception
        * Build trust in you/teacher - we really want the best for them and there is no judgement
    * Build an ongoing, holistic understanding of your pupils and their needs
        * Assessment should be regular and purposeful rather than a one-off event, 
        * seek input from parents/carers as well as the pupil themselves ...
    * Ensure all pupils have access to high quality teaching
        * flexible grouping;
        * cognitive and metacognitive strategies;
        * explicit instruction;
        * using technology
    * Complement high quality teaching with carefully selected small-group and one-to-one interventions
    * Work effectively with teaching assistants

Case Study: (slightly close to home) C# Undergrads
Same course - personalised support


Accessibility
-------------

As teachers we will create digital content and put this on VLE's (Virtual Learning Environments).
We need to adhere to government requirements

TASK: Skim read (10min) - As a group - relay anything that we as teachers need to consider about out content?

ITT CCF 
* > 4.10 How pupils are grouped is also important; care should be taken to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation
* > 5.4 Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils.

### Mixed ability grouping

* [Mixed-attainment teaching: Careful steps towards better outcomes](https://impact.chartered.college/article/ehrlich_mixed-attainment-teaching-outcomes/) May 2018 Impact- Chartered College of Teaching
    * > children working in groups with others working at the same level of attainment – has been found to have a number of negative impacts on pupils, yet teachers often cite it as necessary for differentiating and meeting targets (Francis et al., 2017)
    * > As I feared, switching to mixed-attainment groupings initially proved to be a nightmare. Higher attainers dominated, lower attainers withdrew, arguments arose and little work seemed to get done.
    * Group composition
    * Student skills to develop
        * listening, sharing and respecting each other’s right to learn were all identified as being areas in need of work
        * highlights specific children who might need extra help developing these skills. This can be done through individual discussions and interventions.
        * treat pupils fairly (don't let high attainers get away with bad behaviour)
    * Lesson design
        * A lot of time was spent thinking about how to create lessons that were more open-ended and less teacher-centred, and which involved pupils having specific roles. Once this becomes the norm, it is no lengthier than designing three different tasks for your ‘tops, middles and bottoms’.
        * Open-ended tasks are far more successful at challenging all levels when planned well. In redesigning learning tasks, by using targeted questions and designated roles and allowing pupils to select their own level of challenge
        * the introduction of meta-learning and empowering pupils to take control of their learning
    * Impact on behaviour
        * as well as stepping back from the learning, teachers can step back from behaviour management too. Perhaps partly because of reduced anxiety about performing in the ‘top’ group or being stuck in the bottom group, pupils who initially misbehaved in group work stopped doing so. Having pupils determine learning rules and uphold them among each other also developed far better behaviour throughout the class. This, combined with the focus on meta-learning and encouraging respect for each other as learners, provides opportunities for pupils to take more responsibility for their own learning and make a real contribution to the group

        * > ... a technique that reduces working memory load for low-knowledge learners (e.g. by providing strong instructional support) might lose its effectiveness and may even bring negative consequences for more knowledgeable learners; they may learn better in an environment with minimal guidance. This is known as the expertise reversal effect ...
        * > ... implication of the effect is the need to develop an adaptive learning environment in which learning materials are tailored in accordance with learners’ current levels of achievement ...

#### Part 2 - Next step? (30min)

The previous directed task serves as a skill foundation.
The real project would be the next step.

* (2 breakout groups) (20 min)
    * How would you construct a task to follow-on the rock-paper-scissors project?
    * What would the task(s) be?
    * How would you motivate all learners to engage with the topic?
    * How would you support the weaker and more advanced students? (Inclusion is the important bit!!!!)
    * How would you consider _constructive alignment_ of assessment?
* Your group should write their notes in the Google doc
* Your group should present your ideas to the other group - elect a spokesperson (10min)

#### Part 3

ITT CCF
* > 3.learn-that Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues the rationale for curriculum choices, the process for arriving at current curriculum choices and how the school’s curriculum materials inform lesson preparation
* > 4.4 Guides, scaffolds and worked examples can help pupils apply new ideas, but should be gradually removed as pupil expertise increases
* > 4.9 Paired and group activities can increase pupil success, but to work together effectively pupils need guidance, support and practice.

(I will unveil my own hypothetical concept suggestions)

My other examples
* Excel - roleplay project
    * Every student has a different _spec_ core rulebook
    * Character sheet generation
        * VLOOKUP, RAND, form controls, MAX. MIN, absolute cell references
        * Level - stats - skills - spells
        * Roll assist
    * Printed output
    * GM Roll assist
    * (Module was never run because "what would the girls do?" - president of AGS was angry)
* A-Level years projects - with grade - linked to spec


My Tips
* Set the problem - 'create a program to'
* Model meta cognition commentary in solving the problem
* Open ended tasks
* Collaboration
* Negotiate
* Independence
* Dialogue

When talking to your whole class, think "Who do I need here now?" Is to too high level for some? is it too low level for others?

### Escape room idea

Disclaimer.
We are time bound.
You may only have 1 hour of KS3 a week. 
To do a project like this you may need a significant investment in time. 
This may be too much for your current SOW and KS3 program. 
This is a _possible concept_ it is not a fully formed or trailed idea.


* Demo the concept of an escape room.
    * Show videos? Bring in equipment? Bring in a guest speaker? Enthuse them.
* Introduce project
    * Individually or in pairs
        * Design and create the code for an escape room puzzle that uses a microbit
            * When a code is entered - unlock a box
            * When a door is opened trigger something
            * Might be a scrambled message on paper that if they match the symbols on paper to the microbit they can decode the message
            * (The goal is not to actually build it thematically visibly, you may create the electronics physically)
        * Consider partnering with 2 other groups to create a theme
            * Haunted house
            * Derelict spaceship
            * Egyptian tomb
    * Assessment criteria
        * Be clear your assessment is of _use of Computing skills_ rather than artwork created to go with the puzzle
        * use of external input
            * buttons sensor
            * relay/magnet

        * marks for puzzle concept
    * Support materials
        * List of basic project suggestions
            * Some weaker students will not no where to start. Give them a choice of three possible achievable simple projects
                * Cycle led's through a pattern. The puzzle is to press the button when the LED's are in a particular arrangement. The arrangement could be found by decoding a message on paper.
        * Setup a class wiki for the project
        * Some links to some more advanced tools
            * Links to Youtube videos? other tutorials/resources? on how to use a depth-sensor?
        * Record a video of you creating a starting project that demos the core skills (could be done live in class and recorded)
    * Assessment could be
        * Video of a them describing to other/students how it works
        * A poster describing how it works
        * Annotated code with comments mapped to assessment criteria
    * Demo at open evening?


* [Combining Webduino Programming With Situated Learning to Promote Computational Thinking, Motivation, and Satisfaction Among High School Students](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/07356331211039961)
    * Situated learning was proposed by Lave and Wenger (1991), who stated that learning is a psychological process of individual meaning construction and a participatory process of surrounding situations. Learning situations are the key to stimulating learners’ internal and external learning motivations and to enabling learners to transform abstract perceptions into concrete thinking (Clancey, 1995)

Lesson Planning
---------------

* Every lesson I relay to students
    * All - of you will
    * Most - of you should
    * Some - of you could
    * (How will you as a teacher know this? you should make a note of % for each of these categories - maybe even some names)
* Reality
    * Plan for 10% absence from every session
    * Explicitly describe in your lesson plan 'What you will do for students that missed last session' (even name them in your plan?)
* Plan for TA




Disadvantaged Students

TASK: What is [Pupil-Premium](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pupil-premium/pupil-premium)? (10min)
You tell me

* [New measures to support disadvantaged children in schools](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-measures-to-support-disadvantaged-children-in-schools)
    * > with every classroom having three children who have come into contact with a social worker
    * > The EEF’s new guidance on how to spend it rightly emphasises recruiting, retaining and developing great teachers
    * > Pupil Premium must not become a cause of unnecessary work for teachers
* [EEF: Pupil Premium Guide](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evidence-summaries/pupil-premium-guide/)
    1. Teaching
        * Professional development
        * Recruitment and retention
        * Support for early career teachers
            * > Weekly individual coaching sessions help to support teachers and subject-specific CPD improves the quality of our pedagogical content knowledge
    2. Targeted academic support
        * Structured interventions
        * Small group tuition
        * One-to-one support
    3. Wider strategies 
        * Behaviour approaches
        * Breakfast clubs
        * Increasing attendance
    * (Some Quotes)
        * wellbeing
            * weekly 1:1 counselling sessions, Occupational Therapy-based interventions
        * communication 
            * (e.g. transport for parents to attend annual reviews, support for pupils to access a range of offsite trips and experiences); 
        * achievement (e.g. individual and small group tuition, personalised homework support and online learning packages) 
        * independence (e.g. weekly work experience opportunities for individuals)

* [Pupil Premium](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pupil-premium/pupil-premium)
    * Publicly-funded schools in England get extra funding from the government to help them improve the attainment of their disadvantaged pupils.
    * Evidence shows that children from disadvantaged backgrounds:
        * generally face extra challenges in reaching their potential at school
        * often do not perform as well as their peers
    * The pupil premium grant is designed to allow schools to help disadvantaged pupils by improving their progress and the exam results they achieve.
    * Schools get ... £935 for every secondary age pupil, who claims free school meals, or who has claimed free school meals in the last 6 years.
    * Schools get £2,300 for every pupil who has left local authority care through adoption

### Metrics of disadvantage?

* Free school meals - important metric!
* Attendance? 
    * moving home? devoice?
* Social Services? foster?
    * [Throwaway Kids: We are sending more foster kids to prison than college](https://www.kansascity.com/news/special-reports/article238206754.html)
* Number of excursions/interventions?

* Disablism == stereotypes of disabled people
* Medical model -> person needs to change/adapt -> anxious, wheelchair, lazy
    * > Underlying the medical model is the belief that the difficulties associated with a disability should be borne wholly by the disabled person, 
        > and that the disabled person should make an extra effort (perhaps in time, effort, money, etc.) to ensure they do not inconvenience anyone else. 
        > They must change and adapt to fit the circumstances and their environment such as attending university.
* Social model of disability -> person needs support -> low-income, negative attitudes, badly designed buildings
* > your responsibility to ensure that your learning and teaching activities and materials are accessible.

Appendix
========

* [SEND code of practice: 0 to 25 years](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25)
    * 1.24
        * High quality teaching that is differentiated and personalised will meet the individual needs of the majority of children and young people.
        * Some children and young people need educational provision that is additional to or different from this.
        * This is special educational provision under Section 21 of the Children and Families Act 2014.
        * Schools and colleges must use their best endeavours to ensure that such provision is made for those who need it.
        * Special educational provision is underpinned by high quality teaching and is compromised by anything less.
    * 1.26
        * As part of its commitments under articles 7 and 24 of the United Nations Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the UK Government is committed to inclusive education of disabled children and young people and the progressive removal of barriers to learning and participation in mainstream education.
    * Section 6: pg91 to pg110
    * 6.2
        * ensure that children and young people with SEN engage in the activities of the school alongside pupils who do not have SEN
        * The quality of teaching for pupils with SEN, and the progress made by pupils, should be a core part of the school’s performance management arrangements and its approach to professional development for all teaching and support staff. School leaders and teaching staff, including the SENCO, should identify any patterns in the identification of SEN
        * The identification of SEN should be built into the overall approach to monitoring the progress and development of all pupils
    * 6.12
        * All pupils should have access to a broad and balanced curriculum. 
        * The National Curriculum Inclusion Statement states that teachers should set high expectations for every pupil, whatever their prior attainment. 
        * Teachers should use appropriate assessment to set targets which are deliberately ambitious. 
        * Potential areas of difficulty should be identified and addressed at the outset. 
        * Lessons should be planned to address potential areas of difficulty and to remove barriers to pupil achievement. 
        * In many cases, such planning will mean that pupils with SEN and disabilities will be able to study the full national curriculum.
    * 6.16
        * Schools should assess each pupil’s current skills and levels of attainment on entry, building on information from previous settings and key stages where appropriate
    * 6.17
        * Class and subject teachers, supported by the senior leadership team, should make regular assessments of progress for all pupils. 
        * These should seek to identify pupils making less than expected progress given their age and individual circumstances
    * 6.18
        * It can include progress in areas other than attainment – for instance where a pupil needs to make additional progress with wider development or social needs in order to make a successful transition to adult life
    * 6.19
        * The first response to such progress should be high quality teaching targeted at their areas of weakness.
        * Where progress continues to be less than expected the class or subject teacher, working with the SENCO, should assess whether the child has SEN
    * 6.21
        * Persistent disruptive or withdrawn behaviours do not necessarily mean that a child or young person has SEN. Where there are concerns, there should be an assessment to determine whether there are any causal factors such as undiagnosed learning difficulties, difficulties with communication or mental health issues. 
        * If it is thought housing, family or other domestic circumstances may be contributing to the presenting behaviour a multi-agency approach
    * 6.22
        * Professionals should also be alert to other events that can lead to learning difficulties or wider mental health difficulties, such as bullying or bereavement.
        * Such events will not always lead to children having SEN but it can have an impact on wellbeing and sometimes this can be severe.
        * Schools should ensure they make appropriate provision for a child’s short-term needs in order to prevent problems escalating.
    * 6.23
        * Slow progress and low attainment do not necessarily mean that a child has SEN and should not automatically lead to a pupil being recorded as having SEN. 
        * However, they may be an indicator of a range of learning difficulties or disabilities.
        * Equally, it should not be assumed that attainment in line with chronological age means that there is no learning difficulty or disability.
        * Some learning difficulties and disabilities occur across the range of cognitive ability and, left unaddressed may lead to frustration, which may manifest itself as disaffection, emotional or behavioural difficulties.
    * 6.24
        * Identifying and assessing SEN for children or young people whose first language is not English requires particular care
    * (6.28 -> 6.35) 4 areas of need
        * Communication / Interaction (6.28, 6.29)
            * Speech Language
            * Autism
            * Aspergers
        * Cognition (6.30, 6.31)
            * Learning difficulties
            * Specific learning difficulties
                * Dyslexic, Dispracsic
        * Social / Emotional (6.32, 6.33)
            * ADHD
            * Attachment Disorder
            * Self Harm
        * Sensory / Physical (6.34, 6.35)
            * Visual
            * Hearing
            * Physical
    * 6.37
        * High quality teaching, differentiated for individual pupils, is the first step in responding to pupils who have or may have SEN.
        * Additional intervention and support cannot compensate for a lack of good quality teaching. 
        * Schools should regularly and carefully review the quality of teaching for all pupils, including those at risk of underachievement.
        * This includes reviewing and, where necessary, improving,teachers’ understanding of strategies to identify and support vulnerable pupils and their knowledge of the SEN most frequently encountered
    * 6.45 Assess
        * ... subject teacher, working with the SENCO, should carry out a clear analysis of the pupil’s needs.
        * This should draw on the teacher’s assessment and experience of the pupil, their previous progress and attainment, as well as information from the school’s core approach to pupil progress, attainment, and behaviour.
        * It should also draw on other subject teachers’ assessments where relevant, the individual’s development in comparison to their peers and national data, the views and experience of parents, the pupil’s own views and, if relevant, advice from external support services.
        * Schools should take seriously any concerns raised by a parent.
        * These should be recorded and compared to the setting’s own assessment and information on how the pupil is developing.
    * 6.49 Plan
        * All teachers and support staff who work with the pupil should be made aware of their needs, the outcomes sought, the support provided and any teaching strategies or approaches that are required. This should also be recorded on the school’s information system.
    * 6.52 Do
        * subject teacher should remain responsible for working with the child on a daily basis. Where the interventions involve group or one-to-one teaching away from the main class or subject teacher, they should still retain responsibility for the pupil.
    * 6.54 Review
        * The impact and quality of the support and interventions should be evaluated, along with the views of the pupil and their parents.
    * 6.65
        * Where a pupil is receiving SEN support, schools should talk to parents regularly to set clear outcomes and review progress towards them
    * 6.66
        * These discussions can build confidence in the actions being taken by the school, but they can also strengthen the impact of SEN support by increasing parental engagement in the approaches and teaching strategies that are being used
    * 6.68
        * Conducting these discussions effectively involves a considerable amount of skill. As with other aspects of good teaching for pupils with SEN, schools should ensure that teaching staff are supported to manage these conversations as part of professional development.
