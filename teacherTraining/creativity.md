Creativity

* [The Four C Model of Creativity](https://www.waldenu.edu/online-masters-programs/ms-in-education/resource/the-four-c-model-of-creativity) Kaufman  2009
    * Mini C - any attempt at new task (meaningful/value to learner)
    * Little C - might be of value to others
    * Pro C - professional value
    * Big C (Einstein) - value to the world

* Computational Thinking and Creativity
    * [Studying interrelations of computational thinking and creativity: A scoping review (2011–2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036013152100230X) 2021 Rotem Israel-Fishelson ArnonHershkovitz
        * TODO! Massive! Loads of references. Compares measures of creativity. This looks like gold!


* [Do Schools Kill Creativity](https://www.ted.com/talks/sir_ken_robinson_do_schools_kill_creativity) TED 18min
    * 72 million views - ULTRA popular
    * Education takes them into a future you can't grasp
    * All kids have tremendous talents and we squander them
    * Creativity should be treated with the same status as literacy
    * "Nobody knows what god looks like" - "they will in a minuet"
    * We get educated out of creativity

* Autonomy over - academic railroad
    * We are teaching things that students are not interested in
* non completion hierarchy wars
* how do you make it less hierarchical

lunchtime? what are the other professionals doing?

* From [The Voices of Solution Tree](https://slideplayer.com/slide/3762685/) - 2011 Dylan Wiliam
    * Example Course (Slide 32)
        * Weeks 1 to 2
            * Individual choice from a range of work provided by the teacher.
            * Student self-assessment using materials provided
        * Weeks 3 to 6
            * Children construct own problems like those in weeks 1 and 2 and select structured math apparatus to aid solutions
        * Weeks 7 to 10
            * Children presented with a new learning objectives, and make up their own problems, without exemplars by the teacher
        * Weeks 11 to 14
            * Children set their own learning objectives, construct appropriate problems, and use appropriate self-assessment
        * Weeks 15 to 20
            * As weeks 1 to 14, but with less monitoring from the teacher and increased freedom of choice and personal responsibility
    * WHAT? .. is this grounded in reality? Many adults can't do this?
        * But Dylan has taught maths in central London schools. Does he know something we don't?



### Escape room idea

Disclaimer.
We are time bound.
You may only have 1 hour of KS3 a week. 
To do a project like this you may need a significant investment in time. 
This may be too much for your current SOW and KS3 program. 
This is a _possible concept_ it is not a fully formed or trailed idea.


* Demo the concept of an escape room.
    * Show videos? Bring in equipment? Bring in a guest speaker? Enthuse them.
* Introduce project
    * Individually or in pairs
        * Design and create the code for an escape room puzzle that uses a microbit
            * When a code is entered - unlock a box
            * When a door is opened trigger something
            * Might be a scrambled message on paper that if they match the symbols on paper to the microbit they can decode the message
            * (The goal is not to actually build it thematically visibly, you may create the electronics physically)
        * Consider partnering with 2 other groups to create a theme
            * Haunted house
            * Derelict spaceship
            * Egyptian tomb
    * Assessment criteria
        * Be clear your assessment is of _use of Computing skills_ rather than artwork created to go with the puzzle
        * use of external input
            * buttons sensor
            * relay/magnet
        * use of external output
            * speaker
            * motor
            * magnetic latch
            * led
        * use of radio communication
            * describe the protocol
            * Transmission? Error handling? Ack?
        * use of a loop
        * use of storage
            * array?
        * use blocks
        * use code
            * code only features
        * collaboration with other teams - protocol design? hardware integration with others
        * marks for puzzle concept
    * Support materials
        * List of basic project suggestions
            * Some weaker students will not no where to start. Give them a choice of three possible achievable simple projects
                * Cycle led's through a pattern. The puzzle is to press the button when the LED's are in a particular arrangement. The arrangement could be found by decoding a message on paper.
        * Setup a class wiki for the project
        * Some links to some more advanced tools
            * Links to Youtube videos? other tutorials/resources? on how to use a depth-sensor?
        * Record a video of you creating a starting project that demos the core skills (could be done live in class and recorded)
    * Assessment could be
        * Video of a them describing to other/students how it works
        * A poster describing how it works
        * Annotated code with comments mapped to assessment criteria
    * Demo at open evening?

    * Situated learning was proposed by Lave and Wenger (1991), who stated that learning is a psychological process of individual meaning construction and a participatory process of surrounding situations. Learning situations are the key to stimulating learners’ internal and external learning motivations and to enabling learners to transform abstract perceptions into concrete thinking (Clancey, 1995)
