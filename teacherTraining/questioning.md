Questioning
===========

* National Center for Education Evaluation [Organizing Instruction and Study to Improve Student Learning](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/PracticeGuide/1) 2007
    * Recommendation 5a
        * Level of evidence: Low
        * Use quizzing to promote learning. Use pre-questions to introduce a new topic.
    * Recommendation 5b
        * Level of evidence: Strong
        * 5b Use quizzing to promote learning. Use quizzes to re-expose students to key content.
            * “closed-book”, delayed exposure
            * require students to actively recall specific information (e.g., questions that use fill-in-the-blank or short-answer formats, as opposed to multiple-choice items) 
    * Recommendation 7: Help students build explanations by asking and answering deep questions.
        * Level of evidence: Strong
        * why, why-not, how, what-if, how does X compare to Y, and what is the evidence for X?

    * > What ultimately counts is the extent to which teaching requires pupils to think, not just report someone elseʼs thinking
    * Computing Context: Evidently social impact of technology. Could we use this to compare different types fo loop? A chain of if statements over data?

Diagnostic/Hinge Questions (2.5 hours)
--------------------------

ITT CCF 4.6
> Questioning is an essential tool for teachers; questions can be used for many purposes, including to check pupils’ prior knowledge, assess understanding and break down problems.

ITT CCF 3.3
> Anticipating common misconceptions within particular subjects is also an important aspect of curricular knowledge; working closely with colleagues to develop an understanding of likely misconceptions is valuable

            * Craig’s Five Golden Rules for Diagnostic Questions
                * They should be clear and unambiguous
                * They should test a single skill or concept
                * Students should be able to answer in less than 20 seconds
                    * More than this means learner is making multiple steps; hard to pin down specific misconception
                * You should learn something from each incorrect response (without the student needing to explain their process)
                * It is not possible to answer the question correctly whilst still holding a key misconception
            * The following questions and prompts can be used with students who are answering the diagnostic questions:
                * Support
                    * Are there any answers you can rule out?
                    * Which answer looks the most sensible?
                    * What topic in the curriculum is this?
                * Extension
                    * Write the best explanation you possibly can for the correct answer
                    * Convince me why each of the alternative answers is wrong
                    * Can you explain what misconception someone has who chooses each of the incorrect answers?
                    * What other alternative incorrect answers would you have included, and why?
                    * Can you write some questions that would make each of the wrong answers correct?
                    * Create your own diagnostic question on this topic, explaining your reasoning behind each of your three incorrect answers
            * Get feedback from students as to 'why' they think that is the answer
                * Find the worst 3 answered questions
                * Step 5: Find the most popular misconceptions and read explanations written by students
                * Step 7: As a teacher - Ask 3 questions:
                    * Where do students go wrong?
                    * Why do they go wrong?
                    * What are we going to do about it?

Dialogic teaching

Common errors in questioning
* Asking:
too many questions at once
a question and answering it yourself
questions only of the brightest or most likeable
a difficult question too early
irrelevant questions
questions in a threatening way
the same kind of questions all the time
* Failing to:
correct wrong answers
indicate a change in the type of question
give students the time to think
pay attention to answers
see the implications of answers
to build on answers

* [SSDD Problems](https://ssddproblems.com/)
    * Same Surface, Different Deep Structure maths problems from Craig Barton @mrbartonmaths
    * Have the same question/example but have questions with different levels of depth
    * [[computerSciencePedagogy]]
    * [[inclusion]]

* Give them the data/answer and ask "What is the question"

* Check understanding - "explain the task back to me ..."

    * [Chapter 1. More Effective Questioning](http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/118002/chapters/More-Effective-Questioning.aspx)
        * Speculative framing. I have found that students are more likely to respond to cold-call questions if they feel they can speculate about possible responses rather than come up with the correct answer
        * Answer scaffolds.
        * Think -> Pair -> Share
        * Pre-Queing (ask question in advance)
        * Inverted Questions - Give answer and ask what the question was
