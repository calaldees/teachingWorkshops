Questioning
===========

* Dialogic Teaching
* Diagnostic Questions
* Hinge Questions

ITT CCF 4.6
> Questioning is an essential tool for teachers; questions can be used for many purposes, including to check pupils’ prior knowledge, assess understanding and break down problems.

ITT CCF 3.3
> Anticipating common misconceptions within particular subjects is also an important aspect of curricular knowledge; working closely with colleagues to develop an understanding of likely misconceptions is valuable


We kind of know about quizzing and spaced repetition from Rosenshines principles
Quiz == good. What about deeper questioning?

* National Center for Education Evaluation [Organizing Instruction and Study to Improve Student Learning](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/PracticeGuide/1) 2007
    * Recommendation 5a
        * Level of evidence: Low
        * Use quizzing to promote learning. Use pre-questions to introduce a new topic.
    * Recommendation 5b
        * Level of evidence: Strong
        * 5b Use quizzing to promote learning. Use quizzes to re-expose students to key content.
            * “closed-book”, delayed exposure
            * require students to actively recall specific information (e.g., questions that use fill-in-the-blank or short-answer formats, as opposed to multiple-choice items) 
    * Recommendation 7: Help students build explanations by asking and answering deep questions.
        * Level of evidence: Strong
        * why, why-not, how, what-if, how does X compare to Y, and what is the evidence for X?
        * (My tip: Put these on your wall display - ask students for a deeper question - go on a journey of exploring - repeat - )
            * dialogic teaching - question giving rise to another question - flip it, they ask the questions

            * Craig’s Five Golden Rules for Diagnostic Questions
                * They should be clear and unambiguous
                * They should test a single skill or concept
                * Students should be able to answer in less than 20 seconds
                    * More than this means learner is making multiple steps; hard to pin down specific misconception
                * You should learn something from each incorrect response (without the student needing to explain their process)
                * It is not possible to answer the question correctly whilst still holding a key misconception
            * The following questions and prompts can be used with students who are answering the diagnostic questions:
                * Support
                    * Are there any answers you can rule out?
                    * Which answer looks the most sensible?
                    * What topic in the curriculum is this?
                * Extension
                    * Write the best explanation you possibly can for the correct answer
                    * Convince me why each of the alternative answers is wrong
                    * Can you explain what misconception someone has who chooses each of the incorrect answers?
                    * What other alternative incorrect answers would you have included, and why?
                    * Can you write some questions that would make each of the wrong answers correct?
                    * Create your own diagnostic question on this topic, explaining your reasoning behind each of your three incorrect answers
            * Get feedback from students. Get them to tell you 'why' they think that is the answer
                * Find the worst 3 answered questions
                * Step 5: Find the most popular misconceptions and read explanations written by students
                * Step 7: As a teacher - Ask 3 questions:
                    * Where do students go wrong?
                    * Why do they go wrong?
                    * What are we going to do about it?

====

* Plan your questions before hand - really important! - explicitly in your lesson plan
* All Class Response System (more next session)
    * Mini whiteboards - hold up fingers - take time to get answers - All class response systems
        * [formative.com](https://www.formative.com/)

* Reduce the number of questions you ask (stop using them as showcase for your knowledge) - raise the quality of the questions to enable thinking
Common errors in questioning
* Asking:
    * too many questions at once
    * a question and answering it yourself
    * questions only of the brightest or most likeable
    * a difficult question too early
    * irrelevant questions
    * questions in a threatening way
    * the same kind of questions all the time
* Failing to:
    * correct wrong answers
    * indicate a change in the type of question
    * give students the time to think
    * pay attention to answers
    * see the implications of answers
    * to build on answers

* [SSDD Problems](https://ssddproblems.com/)

    * Have the same question/example but have questions with different levels of depth

* Give them the data/answer/outcome and ask "What is the question"

* Check understanding - "explain the task back to me ..."

* [Pause-Pose-Pounce-Bounce](https://my.chartered.college/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/7.-Pose-Pause-Pounce-Bounce.pdf)
    * > Dylan Wiliam, a leading expert in formative assessment, criticises the typical questioning model, Initiation Response-Evaluation, where a teacher repeatedly asks a question, gets an answer and then responds themselves
    * Pose-Pause-Pounce-Bounce is a questioning sequence which is much more suited to elicit deep thinking. 
        * The teacher poses a question; 
        * pauses to allow suitable thinking time; 
        * pounces on one student for an initial answer; 
        * and finally bounces the answer to another student who builds on the response.
    * This improve participation, engagement and understanding.
    * Ensure that you pause for long enough to allow sufficient thinking time. This will help students to improve their answers and increase their confidence
    * Use bounce to formatively assess progress.
    * You can also use it to encourage students to build on each other’s points
    * Use this strategy regularly as part of your classroom routine so students expect it and are prepared to answer

* Think-Pair-Share


* Fast and Effective Assessment by Glen Pearsall 2018
    * [Chapter 1. More Effective Questioning](http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/118002/chapters/More-Effective-Questioning.aspx)
        * Speculative framing. 
            * I have found that students are more likely to respond to cold-call questions if they feel they can speculate about possible responses rather than come up with the correct answer
        * Answer scaffolds.
        * Think -> Pair -> Share
        * Pre-Queing (ask question in advance)
        * Inverted Questions - Give answer and ask what the question was

My Example - Demo

Multiple choice - Always Multiple answers are correct - pair confer - this activates multiple levels of recall and discussion

---

The question could be the entire lesson

Compiler errors are GOLD! So much technical terminology
