## Module Aims
To develop the student’s understanding of the fundamental concepts of Programming Frameworks and Languages. 
This module supports the Implement and Operate elements of the CDIO model.
 
## Intended Learning Outcomes 
By the end of the module students should be able to:
1. Demonstrate an understanding of the concept of a Framework in general, a Framework used for Programming, and a Framework used for software Testing.
2. Critically evaluate the effectiveness of a particular framework for an application and platform.
3. Synthesise a small digital artefact using a well-formed programming framework.
 
## Indicative Module Content: 

* The module introduces special purpose frameworks used for special types of applications, such as web applications with special languages such as [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com/) for PHP. 
* Selenium as Testing Framework will be overviewed. 
* JavaScript framework, Bootstrap, jQuery, ExpressJs, and NodeJS will also be introduced. 
* Ruby on Rails will also be covered, where the Framework Rails is used for the development of web applications such as Twitter.
* The major component of this module is using the .NET bundle of frameworks; namely .NET Framework, .NET Core with .NET standard, and Angular with Node.js. 
* Microsoft Visual Studio will be used as the application development environment to create different types of simple applications that can run on different platforms including Windows, Linux, and mobile devices. 
* Patterns used within the frameworks such as MVVM and MVC will also be explored. 
* Comparisons will be made between native development and the use of frameworks in, for example, mobile platform development will be covered.
 
## Learning and Teaching Strategies
The module will be taught in a lab using mixed mode delivery as required, so that theory, practical and discussion can take place as required within one session.
Students will demonstrate progress in their assignment and will have the opportunity to gain feedback of their understanding in each session through the artefacts they are working on.

| Programming Project | Digital Artefact | 60% | 2400 |

## Brief Description of Assignments

### Framework Evaluation
The assessment will made available using one or more software applications that is already built using a framework. 
Students will evaluate the implementation in a report using an evaluation template included in the assignment brief. 

### Programming Project
The students will design and program a software application using the most appropriate programming framework available to them. 
This will include writing a reflection report stating the motivation behind selecting that particular framework, and include the advantages and disadvantages of using such framework.
