Are you a pudding?
==================


General Advice
--------------

Banned terms in technical reports
* Easier to use
* User Friendly

* Be specific - generalisations are meaningless.
* You must qualify _what_ and _why_


Choice of server framework
--------------------------

* Things we did
    * showed you the OpenAPI spec for the REST api that are creating
    * showed you `curl` commands for the working example service with json
    * showed you have to create a server that could return json in Falcon, Sanic, Express.js
    * gave you the code as working examples with Makefiles for these three solutions in the repo
* So imagine my surprise ... when the vast majority of this room, spent 600 words talking about "easy to use" ... and you never stopped to think ... 
* Why did our teacher:
    * Give us an OpenAPI spec?
    * Why did they create a working implementation for us to use?
    * Why did they show us how to use it with `curl`
    * Why did they show the foundations of 3 possible technologies with examples
* And then you decided to write 600 words of unfocused nonsense that was not related to the business-requirement, specification, goal, target, assessment-objective
* Why did you try to justify a technology that you have not even attempted to serve a REST endpoint that returns JSON

Have I failed you all with my utter inability to teach? 
or are you a bunch of award-winning puddings?
