Are you a pudding?
==================


Assignment 1 - feedback
-----------------------

* Your year-groups background - you have my understanding
* Reflection on where you are now - what is required in industry?
* How many of you 
    * implemented a json response in your chosen server framework?
    * implemented a button action in your chosen client framework?
    * If your answer is "no" then you are behind in this module
* Attendance in session of assignment submission - poor - disappointing
* This is level 6.


General Advice
--------------

Banned terms in technical reports
* "Easier to use"
* "User Friendly"

* Be specific - generalisations are meaningless.
* You must qualify _what_ and _why_.
    * Most people were unable to articulate _why_


Choice of server framework
--------------------------

* Things we did
    * showed you the OpenAPI spec for the REST api that are creating
    * showed you `curl` commands for the working example service with json
    * showed you have to create a server that could return json in Falcon, Sanic, Express.js
    * gave you the code as working examples with Makefiles for these three solutions in the repo
* So imagine my surprise ... when many people, spent 600 words talking about "easy to use" ... 
* Why did our teacher:
    * Give us an OpenAPI spec?
    * Why did they create a working implementation for us to use?
    * Why did they show us how to use it with `curl`
    * Why did they show the foundations of 3 possible technologies with examples
* Why did you try to justify a technology that you have not even attempted to serve a REST endpoint that returns JSON?
    * This is not trivial in Django -> DjangoRESTFramework


Choice of client framework
--------------------------

* Example ...
* Why is jsx useful?
* Look at the example .. think .. tell me
    * https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html#updating-the-rendered-element
* If you don't know ... use google

Hours
-----

* Module handbook
    * Study hours for the module: 200
        * Number of contact hour and pattern of delivery: 50 hours
        * Number of hours when students are expected to study independently or amongst peers, with no direct academic contact: 150 hours of Practice learning and independent study
* We have had `6 * 4 = 24` hours so far (not including this one)
* Have you contributed `24 * 3` = 72 hours? (that's 2 weeks full-time work at a desk with one hour break a day)
* 4 session left (after this one)


What now
--------

Have I let you down with my teaching?
or are you a bunch of award-winning puddings?


### What should have been done differently?

* What additional information? changes? support?
    * (consider that every addition will need a subtraction)
    * (consider we are over half way though this module)
