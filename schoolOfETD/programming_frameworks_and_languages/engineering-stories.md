Bookmarklet - take me to admin - lifts ID and loads admin page in new tab


Projects
--------

Pentatonic hero

LightingAutomation
Displaytrigger
3d Visualiser

MTC Timecodes

Paratrooper
16 hour

Voice activated arcade cabinet

Dune2/UFO - capture wobject satate change


Hack Days
---------

What is it
frantic commits
1 weekend - 16 hours? entire project - free pizza


Freecycle
- sms


Parlementary my dear
- word could based on frequency

Barcode thing
Image processing in js - sure


Car Muse
- built granturismo

Streets of Dfid

TrackMy
- Prototype in 6 hours
Credits for uni course - turn up with 2 profetional developers - help the comunity - dragons den shite

Verbal feedback teacher hack

Retro price


Bugs
----

Civcboom double-click in browser - two requests that collided

Broke the radio stream
 - tests

One competion that failed on live site
GET request from advert

cachebust


User service - 16 requests per page!!!
Make new service 'look' like old


Competition data in db
- filter insert statements
- Provided solution
- never removed - I provided solutions
    - copy data out to another datafile
    - what if we want the data - YOU DONT GET IT! - statistics (in app, why not a ***ing spreadsheet)



CICD - all brands + mobile check

Change to herald prevented app from starting



Altercations
------------

* Personal competition data
* Site scraping - robots.txt obedience (what's that) - I was rather militant - but it's not in the spec, then I'm not doing it
* You're just a tester - don't tell him
* Radio constantly playing
* We agree to communicate better
* I'm not working at capacity - well work at capacity then
* The fragment system - the designer meltdown (confident muppet)
* Karakara permission - being interrogated by Pchan - I'm a professional developer
* Line length - just use black
* Interview process - give questions as screen (don't waste peoples time)
