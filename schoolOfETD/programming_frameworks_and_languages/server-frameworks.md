Server Frameworks
-----------------

Objectives:
* Understand how to follow a tutorial to run "Hello World" for a range of server side frameworks
* Understand a range of server frameworks features
    1. To justify your choice of server framework (assignment 1)
    2. To critique the missing features of the `server_example` (assignment 1)

Tasks for next week:
1. Use a server framework
    * Find a server framework on your own
    * Run "Hello World" server
    * Return a JSON response (e.g. `GET /test --> {"foo": "bar"}`)
2. Research a server framework (for any language)
    * Come prepared to talk about it's features + show link to any example code (5min)

Next week:
* Client frameworks
    * Hello World

### DIY HTTP Server

Java + Python

### DIY Message Board

Python + PHP

### Dynamic Server Frameworks

Static site generation

DB, Templates, Routing

CGI-BIN - write a script in any labnagueg as long as it printed html response
PHP lowered barrier to entry to server - get people started

Wordpress - Framework? Lots of plugs
No other frameworks at the time

CodIgnitor PHP - Laravell (new) PHP
Node.js
Rails (Ruby)
Falcon

Shimmi - own framework - 
v1 hardcoded for one use - image board - could not do anything else with it
v2 others interested but wanted differnt features - started plugings - made a minimum engine. Everything was a plugin that spoke to each other. Event system page event kicks it off - login plugin

Falcon Framework

* https://www.fullstackpython.com/falcon.html
    * > Falcon is a WSGI-compliant web framework designed to build RESTful APIs without requiring external code library dependencies.

* https://impythonist.wordpress.com/2015/09/12/build-massively-scalable-restful-api-with-falcon-and-pypy/
    * > Namaste everyone. If you build a RESTFul API for some purpose, what technology stack you use in python and why?. I may receive the following answers from you.
      > 1)  I use Flask with Flask-RESTFul
      > 2)  I use (Django + Tastypie) or (Django + REST Framework)
      > Both options are not suitable for me. Because there is a very good light-weight API framework available in python called Falcon. I always keep my project and REST API loosely coupled. It means my REST API knows little about the Django or Flask project that is being implemented. Creating cloud APIâ€™s with low-level web framework than a bulky wrapped one always speeds up my API.

Django REST Framework
---------------------
A framework, build on another framework

https://www.fullstackpython.com/django-rest-framework-drf.html

Built on top of Django for API's

Web visible interface - multiple dataformat serialzers
Generates openAPI spec from working program

    * My demo for building and running Microsofts demo TodoApi app in docker containers
1. Start a new- gitpod workspace from the repo above
    * `https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/USERNAME/REPONAME`
2. build and run the example application
    * `http://localhost:5000/WeatherForecast`
3. Inspect the `TodoApi` folder
    * Try to identify the components of the web app
    * Look at the `Dockerfile`. Try to understand the steps it might be doing

* Discuss: What is Microsoft trying to achieve?
    * How might this relate to our criteria for selecting a framework?


Snaic

* https://sanicframework.org/

1. Follow "Getting Started" and run the basic app
    * https://sanicframework.org/en/guide/getting-started.html#getting-started
2. Add a response to the path `/test` to return the json `{"foo": "bar"}`
    * https://sanicframework.org/en/guide/basics/response.html#methods
3. Build a docker container to run this
    * `Dockerfile`
        * ```Dockerfile
            FROM python:slim
            WORKDIR /app/
            RUN  ???  ## Install dependencies/frameworks/libraries here ?? what did you install in Getting Started?
            COPY . .
            ENTRYPOINT ["???", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "server.app"]
            ```
        * (host/bind `0.0.0.0` is important for containers)
    * `Makefile`
        * ```Makefile
            DOCKER_IMAGE:=sanic_test
            build:
                docker build --tag {DOCKER_IMAGE} .
            run:

            ```

* https://www.fullstackpython.com/sanic.html
    * > Sanic is a Python web framework built on uvloop and designed for fast HTTP responses via asynchronous request handling. 
    * > Sanic cannot be developed or deployed on Windows due to its necessary uvloop dependency.
    * > There was an excellent discussion on the /r/python subreddit about using one of the newer async frameworks such as Sanic or Japronto compared with a traditional web framework like Django. 
      > One of the major tradeoff of adopting a newer framework is simply that the code library ecosystem has not, and may never, grow up around that framework. 
      > You have to accept the risk that you will need to build a significant amount of the plumbing yourself rather than pip installing existing, well-tested libraries.
