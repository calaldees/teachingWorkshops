Assignment - Technical Report
----------

### Overview
Create a 1600 word technical report. This will be 40% of this module.

* A repository has been setup with an existing prototype implementation with working test suites.
* [github.com/calaldees/frameworks_and_languages_module](https://github.com/calaldees/frameworks_and_languages_module)
* Clone this repository and inspect it's functionally.
* In assignment 1 (this assignment) you will be asked to justify a choice of tooling
* In assignment 2 (next assignment) you will be using the tools you have chosen in assignment 1 to implement a new server and client


### Scenario
* You have been employed by FreeCycle-Inc as a Lead Engineer
* Your role is to technically advise and implement FreeCycle's digital products on web and mobile platforms
* Freecycle-Inc have an existing working prototype for their FreeCycle platform with tests. (see assessment 2 - example)
* The business requires you to implement a deployable/working version of the system within 3 months (see assessment 2 - deadline)

### Task
Produce a summary technical report to the business directors (1600 words total)
The report should contain:
* A description of why the existing prototype implementation is not fit for business use (300 words)
* A recommendation about the proposed technical direction:
  * Server Implementation (600 words)
    * Language justification
    * Framework justification
  * Client Implementation (600 words)
    * Language justification
    * Framework justification
* Consider a 2 year technical roadmap for this implementation (timeframes) (100 words)
* Provide a set of references for your justification (references do not count towards word count)

### Guidance
* Level of Expectation:
  * This task is intended to mimics a genuine task that might be required of you as a software engineer. This is a scenario for a learning exercise and lacks some of nuance of a real problem.
  * Realistically; You are not a lead developer. You are not expected to write this to a true industry standard. You are trying to demonstrate to an external examiner your knowledge and understanding.
* You are being assessed on your justification/critique of the technical implementation and technology. You are not marked on critique of the user functionality that has been proposed.
* It is perfectly acceptable to consider interim solutions/technology
  * example:
    * > We will use XYZ for the next 3 months as this will allow us to bring the product to market quickly. We will automatically have an admin panel for data and will easily be able to hire/contact this skill-set cheaply at short notice.
    * > We will then focus on a scaleable THINGY solution to replace the XYZ implementation for version 2 of the API in 9 months time.
* Technical reports heavily used bullet points. You do not need to write in full english paragraphs all the time.
  * Consider 'Lean documentation'
* Your justifications need to be supported with references. Show links to blog articles and case studies that support your technical assessment/recommendations. It is an institutional policy to use Harvard style referencing.


#### Marking Criteria
TODO?
* Quality of justification
  * Wide range of technical and business factors are considered (skills marketplace, lead time, scale, maintainability, deployment)
* Referencing/Supporting Evidence
* Quality of written communication
