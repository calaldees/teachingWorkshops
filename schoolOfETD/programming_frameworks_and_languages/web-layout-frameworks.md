HTML Styles
-----------

Old horrible example
```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>html test</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 style="color: red; font-size: 10em;">My Heading</h1>
    <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: square;">Thing</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: square;">Thing again</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: square;">Thing more</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```
Does not scale - as project grows, difficult to maintain consistency

CSS

Refresher and some advanced features

### CSS Style tags

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>html test</title>
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: red;
            font-size: 3em;
        }

        ul li {
            list-style-type: square;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Heading</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Thing</li>
        <li>Thing again</li>
        <li>Thing more</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Another list</li>
        <li>Another list2</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

### Style ID's and Class's

* ID - prefixed  with `#`
    * Only one
    * I tend to only use ID's when their is javascript interaction or associated code/behaviour
* class - refixed with `.`
    * Can be applied many times

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>html test</title>
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: red;
            font-size: 3em;
        }

        ul li {
            list-style-type: square;
        }

        #my_list li {
            display: inline-block;
            border-radius: 1em;
            background-color: lightgray;
            padding: 1em;
            margin: 1em;
        }

        .highlight {
            color: greenyellow;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Heading</h1>
    <ul id="my_list">
        <li>Thing</li>
        <li>Thing again</li>
        <li class="highlight">Thing more</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li class="highlight">Another list</li>
        <li>Another list2</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

Advanced CSS
------------

### Transitions with animation

Add the following to the above example
```css
        #my_list li {
            /* ... */
            transition: background-color 1000ms linear;
        }
        #my_list li:hover {
            background-color: red;
        }
```

### Style Class's on parent

1. Add this css
    * ```css
        .big #my_list li {
            padding: 2em;
            font-size: larger;
        }
        ```
2. Manually in dev-tools add the class `big` to `body`
    * see it work
3. Add some javascript to toggle the class
```html
<button id="big_button">Make Big</button>

<script type="module">
    const $body = document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0];
    const $element = document.getElementById("big_button");
    $element.addEventListener("click", event => {
        $body.classList.toggle("big");
    });
</script>
```

### Media Queries

Add the css below and resize the browser to less than 600px.
```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
```

Problems with CSS
-----------------

* Problems
    * It quickly becomes unmanageable
        * elements that inherit form multiple styles create changes all over the site
        * All styles are intertwined somehow
        * Lots and lots of class names that are not named consistently
    * Difficult to make sites look consistent
    * Lost of css required to support responsive design with multiple media query sizes
* Solutions
    * [Sass: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS with superpowers 
        * preprocessor scripting language for css
            * Variables, functions, mixins
        * You write in something similar to CSS with cool new features and it generate css files
            * If css your css was complicated before - with sass you've now made it even more complicated
            * Can generate an ungodly amount of plain css as output if used unchecked
        * [Sass in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDIJa0AP5c) video
    * CSS Frameworks
        * People that have made MANY beautiful websites have structured their knowledge into refined tools we can use
        * Beware - once you use it, you're locked in! - escape is difficult


12 part grid system
-------------------

* Why not use base 10!
    * Divide by two! yeah! now again .. oh .. 
    * Divide by three ... oh .. 
    * Divide by four ... oh .. 
* Why base 12 is amazing! You can divided it by
    * Two! yeah! and again .. YEAH!
    * Divide by 3, yeah!
    * Divide by 4, YEAH!
    * Divide by 6 yeah!
    * You can slice by quarter and 3rd without fractions

Skeleton
--------

* http://getskeleton.com
* A dead simple, responsive boilerplate
* Light as a feather at ~400 lines & built with mobile in mind
* Styles designed to be a starting point, not a UI framework
* Quick to start with zero compiling or installing necessary

* Only one breakpoint (to start with)
* Very very lightweight demo


tailwindcss
-----------

* [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
    * Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.
    * [Utility First](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first)

* My opinion
    * Great when used with a client framework with reusable components
    * Templates become very verbose and bloated - hard to read
    * `@apply` could solve some of this, but requires css compilation framework

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <!-- From: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#using-tailwind-via-cdn -->
  <link href="https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@^2/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

<body>

    <div class="p-6 max-w-sm mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md flex items-center space-x-4">
        <div class="flex-shrink-0">
            <img class="h-12 w-12" src="/img/logo.svg" alt="ChitChat Logo">
        </div>
        <div>
            <div class="text-xl font-medium text-black">ChitChat</div>
            <p class="text-gray-500">You have a new message!</p>
        </div>
    </div>


</body>
</html>
```

* padding `p-??` and margin `m-??` 

https://tailwindcss.com/docs/width
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/border-radius#pills-and-circles
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/divide-width#add-borders-between-horizontal-children

Forms is not part of default functionality - requires plugin


Pure.css
--------
https://purecss.io/
* see getting started and grid system
* Pure ships with both a 5ths and 24ths based grid

Bit more than skeleton but still pretty bare bones


Material Design (Google)
------------------------

* [materializecss](https://materializecss.com/about.html)
    * > A modern responsive front-end framework based on Material Design
    * Motion provides meaning + colour
    * [Material Design](https://material.io/)
        * [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) searchable
        * [Googled tried to enforce Material Design on iOS platforms](https://sixcolors.com/link/2021/10/googles-apps-to-embrace-ios-on-ios/) they gave up in 2021 because (quite rightly) the users were annoyed and confused

Guidance with Assignment 2
==========================

Time to start your server and client implementations.
* Clone the repo
* Make commits
* You will submit a repo for me to run your project
* I will details how you will submit your repo over the next few weeks
* Build you server in `server/`
* Make a `Dockerfile` to ensure your server can be run from a container
* Run test on your sever `make test_server`

Missing from last week
* Demo accessing API form javascript (as this failed last week)
