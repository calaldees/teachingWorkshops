PAT: Engagement Concerns - DOUGHNUT - Programming Frameworks and Languages (U14465)

Dear DOUGHNUT,
(cc'ing 
    XXX as PAT,
    XXX as Course Director,
)

You are currently not engaging with Programming Frameworks and Languages (U14465) 2022/2023.

((You are registered on the module with Re-Assessment with attendance - you are currently not attending))

You have attended x out of X sessions.
You have not contacted me to explain your absence.
Every session has vital information about the module. Even though sessions are recorded, It is exceptionally difficult to catchup the missing content. I do not see evidence in the video statistics that you have accessed the missing content.
You have arrived late to sessions x times. This has made it more difficult for your to engage with the content as the initial instructions are vital to your understanding. I do not have the time to repeat significant chunks of content in the session. Being late puts you at a significant disadvantage.

Currently you have not made process with your assignment and have not committed any work-in-progress.
Unless you work consistently throughout the module, it is unlikely you have the time and skills to complete the assignments before the deadline.
At this point in the course you need to be spending considerable time exploring a range of frameworks.
There is currently no evidence to support you have engage outside of lectures.
A reminder; a module should take 200 hours. 50 hours of supervised/lectures/input and 150 hours of independent study.

I have demonstrated the creation of a complete working server and working client in two frameworks. I have not seen any evidence that you can read and follow professional documentation fluently to produce your own solution. My demonstrations are vital to building your understanding.

We are currently in week 3 of 12. We are 25% though the module. You have not started your assessment implementation.
Unless you put significant time you are currently on track to fail this module.

It is worth noting; If you provide a solution that have been entirely constructed outside of scheduled session time, we will invite you to a viva to explain your process and show the understanding of our solution. If you are not able to demonstrate a complete understanding of your solution/process, a plagiarism panel will be raised.

Your action points:
1. Catch up on missed lectures via Blackboard/Recap
2. Attend all future sessions and take advantage of all the provided supervised support sessions in the afternoons
3. Make progress on your assignment 1 submission and ensure this is committed frequently your repository

You must make use of the support that is available to you.
I hope to see you in our next lecture.

Hi XXX,

Your family and friends will always take priority in your life.
In the workplace you must communicate effectively with your employer.
In the past I have had many students that silently disengaged with the course.
If these students issues had been identified sooner, then support could have been put in place sooner.
I am monitoring your progress to help you succeed in this module.

Focus on your family.
Keep your lecturers informed of attendance issues.
Keep communicating about your plans to catchup and your progress.

Let's catchup soon.

Hi XXX,
(cc'ing xxx as PAT and XXX as Course Director as part of process)

I am concerned about your progress with "Programming Frameworks and Languages (U14465)" this year.
Your attendance in sessions has been generally good.
You attended remotely last session and I was unable to discuss your progress with you.

You have not made any commits to your repository in over two weeks. Your progress with Assignment 1 has been very limited.
We are now half way though the module. If you do not complete the server implementation within the next couple of weeks, it is unlikely that you will accrue enough marks to pass this module by December.
I will be providing additional supervised support sessions on Monday afternoons. I strongly recommend you take advantage of this additional support to make progress.

You have made no visible progress on Assignment 2. Although the deadline for Assignment 2 is after Christmas, I strongly recommend you start to consolidate your thinking and begin this write-up. We will be taking time each session to discuss wording for Assignment 2. To participate in these writing workshops you need to be making progress on your writing.

I look forward to seeing you next session to support you with your progress.
