PFL - Assignment 2 - Submission Guidelines
==========================================

To be in-line with the universities written submission policy. You will have have to submit your Assignment 2 report via TurnitIn.

The recommended way to do this is to convert your Markdown document to PDF. This method is prefered as this will preserve the formatting of 'code blocks'.

You are to generate a PDF document for your report and submit this via the TurnitIn bucket by 14:00 on Monday 9th January 2023.
[TurnitIt Bucket: Assignment 2](https://learn.canterbury.ac.uk/ultra/courses/_19265_1/outline/lti/launchFrame?toolHref=https:~2F~2Flearn.canterbury.ac.uk~2Fwebapps~2Fblackboard~2Fexecute~2Fblti~2FlaunchLink%3Fcourse_id%3D_19265_1%26content_id%3D_3576401_1%26from_ultra%3Dtrue)

As a backup - an automated script will take a snapshop of your GitHub repository at 14:00 on Monday 9th January 2023. This is not a replacement for the TurnitIn submission.
