New Module
----------

* Not been run before
    * Marks for whole cohort can be scaled
* Your feedback is important


Module Overview
---------------

<sub>Hint: Take notes .... seriously! ... get a notepad, or open a text document. Get ready!</sub>

TASK: (10min) 
* Find - the module handbook - read
* Whiteboard - What do you think is in this module?

## Module Aims
To develop the studentâ€™s understanding of the fundamental concepts of Programming Frameworks and Languages. 
This module supports the Implement and Operate elements of the CDIO model.

### Intended Learning Outcomes 
By the end of the module students should be able to:
1. Demonstrate an understanding of the concept of a Framework in general, a Framework used for Programming, and a Framework used for software Testing
2. Critically evaluate the effectiveness of a particular framework for an application and platform
3. Synthesise a small digital artefact using a well-formed programming framework

Whiteboard in half: words to describe
* What is a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)?
* What is a [software framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework)?

The sign of an armature:
> _TECH_XYZ_ is rubbish
This module will help develop an important part of your professional skill-set: 
> The ability to discuss and reason about technology choices

* Language
  * A formal structure to describe machine behaviour
* Framework
  * Inversion of control
    * It calls you, rather than you call it

### How will we learn

1. Focus on a business engineering problem with real industry tools
    * Hand on each week with a range of tools
2. Discussion
    * Real researchers and engineers can discuss/reason about technology
    * (Hack time, coffee-area chat)

#### Level 6
* Level 4 - You are told what to do
* Level 5 - Supported developing competency in a range of problem domains
* Level 6 - You are able to self direct

* My role is NOT to have all the answers. 
* My role is to facilitate your transition towards a skilled professional.

#### Session Overview - Online/Campus

Task: Look on blackboard at session list

* 2 weeks online
    * Blackboard
* 2 weeks on campus
    * 09:00 - 13:00 Lab (if we can fit in one room)

### Run it yourself (1 hour)

* Demo: (15min)
* Task: (30min)
* QA

<sub>Seriously ... make notes ... </sub>

Demo:
* Fork
* The IDE
* The Interaction (public port)
* The tests


1. Fork and run the project on GitPod
2. Add an item with the web interface
3. Run the tests


### Public Repo?
* Will confer with course directors
