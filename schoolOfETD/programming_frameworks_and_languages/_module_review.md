Module Review
=============

Course: September 2021 to January 2022 (4 months)
Review: January 2022



* The tasks (Assignment 1 writeup 40% + Assignment 2 Digital artifact 60%) were of an appropriate difficulty for level 6.
    * Assessment marking ratios will remain the same next year
    * Mark scheme for Assignment 1 wiriteup will be revised to support peer review
    * Assessment1 submission date should be moved to week 6 or 7 to allow for response to formative feedback
* Viva assessment process was a strong deterrent for plagiarism

* There was little evidence that students were engaging with self study
    * Theory: Students were used to being guided by teacher lead directed tasks
    * Actions:
        * Assignments are clearly set into segments - expect incremental weekley submission of tasks. 
        * Weekley tasks are peer reviewed. Teacher will moderate all peer reviews and commenting where peer assessment differs from teacher assessment.
        * Teacher will keep log of progress on with responsive-time-on-track logging (see note below)
        * Students strongly advised "Attend afternoon session (optional)" 
            * If no attendance at afternoon session and non submission in following weeks peer review, advise student of failing module - with a module this big there is no "catchup later". Reported to PAT (maybe via automation?)
            * If they don't take advantage of support this is recorded
* Students lacked the writing skills to articulate their ideas in writing
    * Reason: The marking criteria of assignment 1 were inaccessible to students. They did not have a mental model of what was expected.
    * Actions: 
        * Create a set of small structured writing templates/prompts
            * > What is the feature -> What problem is this trying to solve -> How does it solve the problem
                * prepare a few exemplar paragraphs that follow this structure
            * Prepare students to a point where they can perform effective peer reviews on each others writing
* Students lacked graduate-attributes/professional-skills to collaborate/comment on code
    * Theory: Majority of education has focused on solo tasks and being individually assessed
    * Expected behaviours: students talk about code regularly, justify the code they have written that week and read/discuss others code weekley
    * Action:
        * Students encouraged to peer review each other's open source repo continuously throughout the module

Actions:
* A weekley timetable of tasks + expected outcomes will be published at the start of the module.
    * These will incrementally build up the existing submission points (week 5 and week 11)


Communication to students
* You are still developing your ability to manage your time - you need support in doing this
* Explain the meaning of 150hours self study .. really ..



---

One student had skill but ignored the tests and spec -- this made marking very difficult as technical skill and tests that pass were dificult to disentangle

TODO
----

* update openapi spec
    * [OpenAPI Spec](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calaldees/frameworks_and_languages_module/after_assignment_updates/openapi.yml)
* Fix test startup to just check port and not expect a 200 (this bar was too high)
* Break down client tests into smaller sub components? Is this possible?
* Split competencies test/language/framework/container? dimensions in rubric
    * Make the assessment more 'tick list'? Does it run in containers, do tests run, does it validate input, does it create a new id. This seems tedious.
* Template for technical report - style guide - language examples

* Last session leaning objective - what is a framework - test?

* Live script to clone and give feedback on repos that dont pass particular tests (at particular datetime) - live readout on web?
* Technical report will be in markdown and commited to repo
* Mark by peer pull request

### Assignment 2 - Marking criteria is not fit for purpose
Dilema - Jure/Michael comparison - Code does not tell the whole story
Time consuming - viva presentation very successful - more assessment in this manner?
How should the criteria be reworked to mark this?
