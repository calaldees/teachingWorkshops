Microbit
========

* Strengths
    * Multiple Languages (+trivially switch between them)
        * Blocks (like Scratch)
        * Typescript/Javascript
        * Micro Python
    * Simulator is free and accessible in browser (including simulated mutliple devices for radio)
        * Upload via USB
    * Simulator + editor available for mobile phones (blocks)
    * Emphasis on connectivity + radio + comms
    * Physical manifestiation of code
        * Car (robot)
        * Electronic circuits
    * serial [debug stream](https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000095729-displaying-live-serial-data-from-the-micro-bit-in-the-makecode-console-) write/read (full serial)
        * plot on graph
* Weakness's
    * Bluetooth upload is a lie/mess
        * mobile is broken on my andorid
        * web (with experimental extension `about->experimental->web-bluetooth-upload`) chrome 70+ - pairs but offers no icon/mode to upload
        * Uploading + power via USB will desintegrate the board in classroom use (too much physical use)
    * Power is clumsy
    * Expensive!!!
        * £13 per board (v1) * 30 == £390 (that's without power, usb or any additional sensors/devices) - minimum £500 for a class set

An interesting tools for transitioning from blocks to text-code. Physical manifestation of code. Difficult to perform anything complexity algorithmic due to limited IO. A useful transitional device for KS3. Great for pairing because of radio.
