Cognitive Bias
==============

> "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool." - Richard Feynman

You have bias's because you are a human.
As humans We must be aware of our bias's

TASK 1: Brainstorm all the bias's you can think of

TASK 2: Compare your list to these lists

Survivorship bias - the ones that survive tell the story and give advice - the ones that don't survive don't

Logical Fallacies
=================

* [Master List of Logical Fallacies](http://utminers.utep.edu/omwilliamson/ENGL1311/fallacies.htm)
* [logicalfallacies.org](https://www.logicalfallacies.org/)
    * A misconception resulting from flaw in reasoning, or a trick or illusion in thoughts that often succeeds in obfuscating facts/truth.

* https://www.schoolofthought.org/
    * Posters for bias and fallacies

Meta Question: How will these fit into your Computing teaching? (if at all?) What can we do with this knowledge?


Observations from others

    * Anecdotal evidence
        * > This is a difficult discussion to have. I think that another reason that we keep returning to the same controversies is that we mostly rely on anecdotal evidence. As we progress through our careers, we observe what works and what doesn't, but it's likely that confirmation bias makes us remember the results that we already favour, whereas we conveniently forget about the outcomes that don't fit our preferred narrative.
        * > Could we settle these discussions with more science? Alas, that's difficult.
        * > I can't think of anything better, then, than keep having the same discussions over and over. I try hard to overcome my biases to understand the other side, and now and then, I learn something that I find illuminating. It doesn't seem to be a particularly efficient way to address these difficult questions, but I don't know what else to do. What's the alternative to discussion? To not discuss? To not exchange ideas? That seems worse.
