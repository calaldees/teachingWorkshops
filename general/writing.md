    * When presenting remove redundant words. "So", "Basically", "Simply", "Just" (See my blog post on [presenting](https://github.com/calaldees/blog/blob/master/skills/presenting.md) )
* [writing one sentence per line](https://sive.rs/1s)
    * It helps you judge each sentence on its own
    * It helps you vary sentence length
    * It helps you move sentences
    * It helps you see first and last words
* Other
    * Be specific; remove Vague words "Things", "Stuff", 
    * Don't use "It" - fully qualify the subject
    * "I think": no need for your opinion. The evidence should support the concluding direction/statements
    * Remove vague or informal qualifiers e.g. "fun" rephrase as "observable higher engagement", "more efficient" rephrase as "observable higher throughput under condition xyx"

    * A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus: 
        * What am I trying to say? 
        * What words will express it? 
        * What image or idiom will make it clearer? 
        * Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? 
        * And he will probably ask himself two more: 
            * Could I put it more shortly? 
            * Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?
* [Programming and Writing](http://antirez.com/news/135)
    * > I believe programming, in this regard, can learn something from writing: when writing the first core of a new system, when the original creator is still alone, isolated, able to do anything, she should pretend that this first core is her only bullet.
