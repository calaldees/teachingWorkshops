https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D

> Anaglyph 3D is the name given to the stereoscopic 3D effect achieved by means of encoding each eye's image using filters of different (usually chromatically opposite) colors, typically red and cyan. Anaglyph 3D images contain two differently filtered colored images, one for each eye

### Videos

* Technolgy notes
    * mpeg loss
        * Traditional single layer videos use LOSSY `mpeg` codecs
        * mpeg compression looses colour information when compressing video.
        * This creates `ghosting` of colour bleeding over red/cyan pictures.
        * This reduces the quality of the 3D effect for videos.
    * lossless
        * Static `png` images are lossless and therefore unaffected by this problem.
        * YouTube has support for recording separate video channels for each eye and mixing the images in realtime.
            * You can filter for videos that support this `3D`.
