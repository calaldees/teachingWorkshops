### Traffic Light Cups (20min)

In a physical classroom you can visibly see the progress of most students. This takes a lot of expertise and concentration. You need to actively move around the room. Your opinion is not always accurate.

* How will you know how your students are progressing at a glance?
    * You could ask for hands up if you're stuck. This is has a number of problems. Must be responded to timely. No granularity.

* Coloured cups give ongoing feedback - 100% of the time - AMAZING tool!
    * Used when working solo
    * Used when you are demoing
    * Used when in group work
* What they mean is for you to define - clearly!
    * Green: Ok
    * Amber: Bit confused, few bumps, need guidance
    * Red: Blocked
* If any kid loses, damages or gratifies their cup - they loose their ability to feedback

    * > Self-assessment doesnâ€™t help students towards becoming autonomous learners. Self-assessment is more like self-deception. The use of choice cards and traffic lighting doesn't encourage student voice and empower student engagement and learning. It clouds it and muddies assessment.
    * > The teacher is the expert, not the pupil and it's us that makes accurate assessments. 
    * > Self-assessment is about as accurate as peer-assessment. If your mate is assessing you then you'll do well. If it's someone that doesn't, expect a list of critiques.

* Extra point of mine - the struggle IS the learning - If you help every time they are actually making progress you train them to take there agency away.
    * _struggle_ is not the same as _disengaged_ or _blocked_

#### Online?
* In an online context Blackboard has support for this 'status' but it is temporal (will decay after 60 seconds).
* How else could we do this online?

### Async - long form
* What about responses systems in an async world?
* How would the tools be different?
    * Wiki? Forums?
