Meta anlysis
Rating of interventions
John Hattie's 'Visible Learning' - Distill it to a number

Where do you start your measuing?
Asumptions

Maths behind meta alysis is not great
"Compare apples and oranges"

Criticality
-----------

* [[criticality]]

* Blended learning
    * Traditional: All learning done in the same classroom with the same teacher
    * Blended: The deliberate planning for different methods of delivery
        * Async/Synchronous 
        * Rotating, rooms, labs, equipment, teachers
* Flipped learning
    * Traditional: Lower order knowledge skills in lessons. Higher order skills (like evaluating) done at home
    * Flipped: Lower order knowledge skills at home (async). Higher order evaluation/discussion (sync) in class

> The problem is that both versions present a false vision of learning. 
> Learning is not a hierarchy or a linear process. 
> This graphic gives the mistaken impression that these cognitive processes are discrete, that it's possible to perform one of these skills separately from others. 
> It also gives the mistaken impression that some of these skills are more difficult
