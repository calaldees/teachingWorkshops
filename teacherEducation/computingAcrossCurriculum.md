    * > If a primary pupil, having spent all afternoon painting a picture of a Roman soldier, neither improved in painting nor knew more about Roman soldiers, was it time well spent?
    * > A secondary pupil measuring personal performance in PE might be making little progress in mathematics skills nor getting fitter. 
    * > Nowadays, the focus on the pedagogy of knowledge transmission indicates measurable progress in learning…a particular approach to pedagogy.
    * > The art of 'knowing why' ... the learning of the "what" will only go so far.

Objectives
----------

Up until this point you've been starting your journey of mechanically teaching computing topics discreetly.
Consider the semantic difference between "A Computing teacher" and "A teacher that has a specialism in Computing".
(I want this session to challenge your perception of your role)

* Understand the power of context based learning
    * Computing can relate to everything in our world and lives
* Consider how we can support our fellow teaching colleges with our Computing skills

### Spotlight questions
* What is a broad and balanced curriculum?
* How do you lead learning?
* (Echo back to) What is a Teacher?

* [Bigger…Broader…Wider…](https://smithsmm.wordpress.com/2016/12/28/bigger-broader-wider/)
    * have a water fight, climb a tree
* Tom Sherrington [Every child should (have the opportunity to.. )](https://twitter.com/teacherhead/status/1527560224294547456)
    * Grow a bean
Sing
Poot insects in long grass
Go to the Museum
Track the moon 
Make a motor
Inflate a sheep's lung!
Read novels (x 100!)
Make a fire
See mountains and the sea
Recite a poem
Give a speech to a real audience
...and ..


### ITT Core Framework

1.2. 
> Teachers are key role models, who can influence the attitudes, values and behaviours of their pupils

3.1.
> A school’s curriculum enables it to set out its vision for the knowledge, skills and values that its pupils will learn, encompassing the national curriculum within a coherent wider vision for successful learning

3.8.
> Pupils are likely to struggle to transfer what has been learnt in one discipline to a new or unfamiliar context.

> Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to revisit the big ideas of the subject over time and teach key concepts through a range of examples.

8.3
> Teachers can make valuable contributions to the wider life of the school in a broad range of ways, including by supporting and developing effective professional relationships with colleagues



Ofsted, Inspections and Computing
--------------------

* National Curriculum
    * > A high-quality computing eduction equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world
    * > Computing has deeps links with mathematics, science and design and technology, and provides insight into both natural and artificial systems.

### Historical Inspection
* [David Drown HMI](https://www.slideshare.net/Ofstednews/inspection-computing-and-e-safety-in-schools) 2014 (stepped down)
    * Teaching in computing is good or better when:
        * it is rooted in the development of pupils’ understanding of important concepts and progression within the lesson and over time; it enables pupils to make connections between individual topics and to see the *big picture*
        * teachers use a very wide range of innovative and imaginative resources and teaching strategies to stimulate pupils’ *active participation* in their learning and secure good or better progress across all aspects of the subject.
    * The computing curriculum is good or better when:
        * the contexts in which computing is taught are *relevant to pupils lives* and reflect the increasing use of computing in the world of industry
        * excellent links are forged with other agencies and the *wider community* to provide a wide range of enrichment activities to promote pupils’ learning and engagement with the subject
        * *links with other subjects in the school* are productive in strengthening pupils’ learning in computing
    * Leadership of computing is good or better when
        * there are effective strategies to delegate subject responsibilities where appropriate and to share good practice
        * computing has a very high profile in the life of the school
    * Finally ...
        * E-safety is now considered in the inspection of all education remits including the early years sector, further education and skills, and initial teacher education.

-------------------------------

* [Computing Across the Curriculum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JBgaR8sNcE) - [Myles Berry](http://milesberry.net/about-3) - CAS TV - June 2016
    * There was a movement to teach ICT without a discreet subject
    * Ask students "Have you understood the world"? "Have you changed the world?"
    * Let's not just do logical reasoning in computing - it applies to other subjects

        * contextualisation of tasks
        * collaborative learning
        * developing computational thinking

Responsibility's of Computing Teachers (lecture 10min)
--------------------------------------

* 3 strands
    * Computer science
    * Information technology
        * not a discrete subject - is supposed to be taught across the curriculum
    * Digital literacy
        * not a discrete subject - is supposed to be conveyed across the curriculum

* As computing teachers we must support:
    * our schools with ICT and digital literacy
        * Very few other teachers will have a background in Computing. Their digital literacy is often weak.
        * Other subjects/staff will need support from you to train them in some aspects of computers (ICT and Computing) for their class's
        * We should consider this _support_ part of our role in schools
    * our subject with strong cross curricular links
        * Literacy
            * [Ofsted Improving literacy in secondary schools: a shared responsibility](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/improving-literacy-in-secondary-schools-a-shared-responsibility)
                > Our world is dominated by the written word, both online and in print. This means we can only contribute and participate actively if we can read and write sufficiently well.

                > where staff had included an objective for literacy in all the lessons, senior managers noted an improvement in outcomes across all subjects
            * Use precise language
                * Many young people cannot convey there ideas (verbally or written)
                * If you can't describe/distil your ideas - you cannot think
                * Subject vocabulary to describe complex problems efficiently
            * [The Secret of Literacy: Making the implicit, explicit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Secret-Literacy-Making-implicit-explicit/dp/1781351279/)

            * [Programmers-Introduction-Mathematics](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programmers-Introduction-Mathematics-Dr-Jeremy/dp/1727125452/)

* Your role
    * You *ARE* the evangelist/ambassador for Computing in your school. For staff and students alike
    * Your enthusiasm and knowledge should permeate the air and infect the people around you
    * You need to convey how Computing changes us and our world

### Computing Terminology cross curricular

These terms could be applied to _all_ subjects.
Can you help other practitioners include these words explicitly in their lessons?

* Logic
    * predicting analysing
* Algorithms (sequencing)
    * making steps & rules
* Decomposition
    * breaking down into parts
* Patterns
    * spotting using similarity's
* Abstraction
    * removing unnecessary detail
    * [picasso abstract bull](https://www.google.com/search?q=picasso+abstract+bull&tbm=isch)
* Evaluation
    * making judgement

Planning cross curricular
-------------------------

(First ideas - taking subjects discreetly)

* How can it be done? Possible options:
    * Discreet Computing lessons reference other subsect areas
        * You using your creativity
        * You invite other subject specialists to be involved in Computing planning
    * Other subject lessons reference Computing concepts
        * As a computing specialist you are involved/consulted in other subjects planning
        * [English: making links with the Computing curriculum](https://www.somerset.org.uk/sites/edtech/Primary%20Computing/Computing%20across%20curriculum/English%20and%20computing.pdf)
            * > Decomposition is used to analyse sentence construction including the recognition of a clause, conjunctions, adverbs and prepositions.
                * See `grammar.py` example later
        * TODO: I want more examples - if you find any, let me know
    * Integrated curriculum - there are no subjects

Don't wait for leadership to tell you what to do.
Get involved with other subjects teachers!

    * > teachers lack information about openly available data sets and their potential use in education. 
    * > Teachers with little expertise in data analytics require extra time and effort, e.g., to identify and visualize data sets as part of their subjects. Thus, strategies are needed to govern open data use in education by addressing these challenges
    * > The studies indicated that for facilitating open data use in schools, a platform is needed that allows teachers to access suitable open data sets for educational purposes.
    * > students might be motivated personally at the prospect of learning more about their own neighborhoods
    * > They need hands-on experience with data collection to understand the data concept and how to use open data

        * Goodhearts Law - once a useful number becomes a measure of success, it ceases to be a useful number.
        *  Textile factories were required to produce quantities of fabric that were specified by length, and so looms were adjusted to make long, narrow strips. 
        *  Uzbek cotton pickers, judged on the weight of their harvest, would soak their cotton in water to make it heavier. 
        *  America’s first transcontinental railroad was built, in the eighteen-sixties, companies were paid per mile of track. So a section outside Omaha, Nebraska, was laid down in a wide arc, rather than a straight line, adding several unnecessary (yet profitable) miles to the rails. 
        * data “may be a pretty decent proxy for something that really matters,” but there’s a critical gap between even the best proxies and the real thing—between what we’re able to measure and what we actually care about.
        * > There are echoes of this in the questions that society aims to answer using data, with a well-known example concerning schools. We might be interested in whether our children are getting a good education, but it’s very hard to pin down exactly what we mean by “good.” Instead, we tend to ask a related and easier question: How well do students perform when examined on some corpus of fact? And so we get the much lamented “teach to the test” syndrome.
        * > For that matter, think about our use of G.D.P. to indicate a country’s economic well-being. By that metric, a schoolteacher could contribute more to a nation’s economic success by assaulting a student and being sent to a high-security prison than by educating the student, owing to all the labour that the teacher’s incarceration would create.

* [Coding for what? Lessons from computing in the curriculum](https://mirandanet.ac.uk/blog/2017/09/02/coding-lessons-computing-curriculum/) 
    * See closing two paragraphs
    * Computing Curriculum is not just about code - its political power
    * > It is time to consider a more socially aware and critical computing education that could engage with the social and political power of code to engineer, in part, how we live and think.


Colleagues and Other Subjects
-----------------------------

If you take an interest in what they are teaching, they will take an interest in what you are teaching.
Becomes friends with other teachers. Passionatly talk about teaching. Passionatly talk about Computing. In turn you will gain insight about their subjects from them.

If Computing was not a subject ... 
------------------------------

### Pre task - Async task (1 hour)

Next session we are looking at "Computing Across the Curriculum".
* Imagine that Computing did not exist as it's own subject and you were employed by a school to integrate computing across the teaching of other subjects.
* Brainstorm and investigate as many ideas as possible.
* How does Computing relate to each subject? (does it?)
* How could a lesson/activity be structured to bridge multiple subjects?
Come prepared to next weeks session with suggestions so we can embark on a discussion.

### Discussion

Shared whiteboard for ideas followed by discussion.

* Scenario: Computing does not exist as a subject on it's own.
* What would Computing in schools look like?
* How could it be done?
* What would the issues be? What would be the benefits?
