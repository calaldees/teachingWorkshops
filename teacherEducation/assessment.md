ITT Core Framework
6.1
> Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and needs
6.2
> Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear
6.4
> pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect
6.5
> High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve
6.6
> Over time, feedback should support pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning.

Teachers' Standards
6 - Make accurate and productive use of assessment  
* know and understand how to assess the relevant subject and curriculum areas, including statutory assessment requirements  
* make use of formative and summative assessment to secure pupils’ progress
* use relevant data to monitor progress, set targets, and plan subsequent lessons  
* give pupils regular feedback, both orally and through accurate marking, and encourage pupils to respond to the feedback.

Introduction - Core Formative assessment principles
------------

* EEF [Teacher Feedback to Improve Pupil Learning](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/tools/guidance-reports/feedback/) 2018 - Six recommendations for using teacher feedback to improve pupil learning
    1. SET EXPECTATIONS: Lay the foundations for effective feedback
    2. TIMELY: Deliver appropriately timed feedback that focuses on moving learning forward
    3. PLAN TO USE: Plan for how pupils will receive and use feedback
    4. WRITTEN: Carefully consider how to use purposeful, and time-efficient, written feedback
    5. VERBAL: Carefully consider how to use purposeful verbal feedback
* [EEF Project: Embedding Formative Assessment](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/projects-and-evaluation/projects/embedding-formative-assessment/) Trial 2018
    * Local teaching groups asked to have a range of collaborative sessions address these 5 key points
        1. clarifying, sharing and understanding learning intentions
        2. engineering effective classroom discussions and activities
        3. providing feedback that moves learning forward
        4. activating learners as instructional resources for one another
        5. activating learners as owners of their own learning
    6. CONSISTENT: Design a school feedback policy that prioritises and exemplifies the principles of effective feedback

### Deference of Formative Assessment and AfL

* [Formative assessment, assessment for learning, and all that jazz](https://www.schooleducationgateway.eu/en/pub/viewpoints/experts/formative-assessment-learning.htm) SchoolEducationGateway.eu 2020
    * Assessment for learning (the purpose of the assessment is to promote learning)
        * is any use of assessment that is primarily intended to improve, rather than measure, learning. 
        * If I tell my students on Monday that there is going to be a test on Friday, and the students study for the test, then the assessment is likely to improve the students’ learning, even if I do not actually give the test on Friday. 
        * Testing can also be highly effective as a study technique: as literally hundreds of psychological experiments have shown, taking a test improves learning even if the test is not scored, because it provides practice in retrieving items from memory, which is known to improve long-term learning.
    * Formative Assessment (the results of the assessment need to be used to improve instruction)
        * An assessment functions formatively to the extent that evidence from the assessment is used – by teachers, by students, or by their peers – to make better decisions about the next steps in instruction.
    * ... “formative” and “summative” ... (are)... different kinds of conclusions that might be drawn from assessment outcomes

* 'Formative assessment' should have been called 'responsive teaching' - 'assessment' makes people think of tests

    * What are the 5 key formative assessment strategies suggested by this trial (read the _Full Project Description_; it's hidden!!)
        * We will be working on our own strategies for these points in the session
    * TLC agendas and materials focused on five key formative assessment strategies: 
        * clarifying, sharing and understanding learning intentions
        * engineering effective classroom  discussions and activities
        * providing  feedback - that  moves  learning  forward
        * activating learners as instructional resources for one another
        * activating learners as owners of their own learning 
    * > Within each of these high-level  concepts, the TLC handouts introduced  multiple formative assessment techniques for teachers to consider

* > The additional progress made by children in the lowest third for prior attainment was greater than that made by children in the highest third.
* > The process evaluation indicated it may take more time for improvements in teaching practices and pupil learning strategies to feed fully into pupil attainment. Many teachers thought that younger students were more receptive to the intervention than their older and more exam-minded peers.

TASK:
* Create a heading in the GoogleDoc for each of the 5 areas
* In pairs take two headings (tutor to assign gruops)
* Think about that heading and add some notes to the GoogleDoc (20min)

### "Assessment Literacy"
* Students have to see the value in the assessment
* Students need to know what each of the assessment types are for (summative/formative)
    * Some students don't see the point in formative assessment (only look at the grade)
    * Some students don't see the point in summative assessment (only care about personal progress and little for the course direction)
    * Some think they know the content already
* Feedback prior to summative assessment is vital

### Bias
* Assessments are a social construct
    * There is bias involved
        * What we think students _deserve_ (antonymous marking is better but sometimes not possible)
    * They are not an exact science

Carless (2015, p.192) defnes feedback as:
> A dialogic process in which learners make sense of information from varied sources and use it to enhance the quality of their work or learning strategies
Feedback also allows us to align with other practioners
Is everything we feedback on accurate, true, relevent, important - do we talk a lot of shit?
Student don't know what feedback is - so you now need to 'cookie message the shit out of this' "This is Feedback: ....". In emails, in conversations
When students are given feedback - most of them don't understand - get them to reciprocate with their intended actions and why

Good Feedback
1. Timely
2. Facilitates self-assessment
3. Delivers high quality information to students about their learning
4. Encourages teacher and peer dialogue
5. Encourages positivity and self-esteem
6. Helps close the gap between current and desired performance
7. Provides valuable information to teachers

Feedback Cycle and Tools (30min)
------------------------

### Make Students Think

* Below are a list of general feedback and marking techniques that prompt students to engage with the feedback
* Read (7min)
* [10 Feedback Techniques That Make Students Think](https://www.dylanwiliamcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/02/10-Feedback-Techniques.pdf) Dylan Wiliam 2015
    1. Marking for improvement
        * When grading student work, record a grade in your grade-book, but only give students written comments on how to improve. Give students time to read the comments in class and one week to resubmit the work. The final grade is the average of the first and resubmitted grade.
    2. Mastery marking
        * Only accept student work when it is of a specific quality. You might only give one grade, an A. Students are expected to continue to redraft and resubmit their work as many times as necessary in order to achieve an A. The overall grade is then determined by the number of As.
    3. +, –, = (Plus, Minus, Equals) 
        * Mark student work in relation to previous work. If the latest work is of the same quality as the last, it receives an ‘=’, if it is better than the last, it receives a ‘+’, and if it is not as good as the last, it receives a ‘–‘. 
    4. Responding to marking
        * Write your teacher feedback, signed and dated, at the start of the exercise book. Students then make an appropriate response below the teacher feedback, including where to find any redrafting. Do not mark the next piece of work until the student has responded to the last feedback provided.
    5. Focused marking
        * Mark student work against one or two specific criteria, even though there may be many criteria that could be marked. This allows you to provide more focused and detailed feedback on these criteria than if everything was marked. The grade-book contains the skill marked rather than the title of the work set.
    6. Find and fix your mistakes
        * Instead of marking answers as correct or incorrect, tell the students the number of answers that were wrong. Give them time in class to find and correct their mistakes, either individually or in groups.
    7. Margin marking
        * Instead of marking each spelling or grammar mistake on essays, place a mark in the margin. Students then find their own mistakes and correct them
    8. Traffic lights
        * Give students a RED, AMBER or GREEN mark for a piece of work. All RED and AMBER work can be redrafted in an attempt to achieve a GREEN mark. The final grade is calculated from the number of GREEN and AMBER marks
    9. Aim for the next level
        * Students identify areas of improvement by comparing their work to exemplars at the next level of achievement. Students realize that they need to set themselves higher standards. Able students find that they can improve a good piece of work.
    10. Match comments to work 
        * Write comments about students’ work on strips of paper without names. Sit students in groups of four. Each group of four students gets back their four pieces of work and their four comments. The group needs to decide which comment goes with which piece of work.

Consider the question below
* Most of these examples are about a student having a paper workbook (some computing teachers do this!)
    * Can you describe an example of any of these that map to the context of teaching Computing in a digital/remote classroom?


### Feedback Loop/Cycle

* Teacher needs to actively monitor work
    * Students need to know that you care about the work (if you don't care, why should they care)
* Teacher give actionable feedback
* Students needs to digest and then action
* Teacher identify that action has been taken based on the feedback

    * > Student feedback is a contentious and confusing issue throughout higher education institutions. This paper develops and analyses two models of feedback: 
        * > the first is based on the origins of the term in the disciplines of engineering and biology. It positions teachers as the drivers of feedback. 
        * > The second draws on ideas of sustainable assessment. This positions learners as having a key role in driving learning, and thus generating and soliciting their own feedback. It suggests that the second model equips students beyond the immediate task and does not lead to false expectations that courses cannot deliver.
    * Curriculum design
    * Time-on-task, the most thoroughly documented contributor to student achievement (Hattie 2009)
    * > there needs to be a way of detecting that there has been an effect in the direction desired. The cycle of feedback needs to be completed. If there is no discernable effect, then feedback has not occurred.
    * Sadler (1989, 78) to identify three conditions for effective feedback: 
        * (1) student knowledge of the standards that needs to be applied; 
        * (2) having to compare those standards to the students’ own work and 
        * (3) the student taking action to close the gap between the two. 
        * The second and third conditions both require the student to actively engage with the feedback.
    * four characteristics of sustainable feedback:
        1. involving students in dialogues about learning which raise their awareness of quality performance;
        2. facilitating feedback processes through which students are stimulated to develop capacities in monitoring and evaluating their own learning;
        3. enhancing student capacities for ongoing lifelong learning by supporting student development of skills for goal setting and planning their learning and
        4. designing assessment tasks to facilitate student engagement over time in which feedback from varied sources is generated, processed and used to enhance performance on multiple stages of assignments
    * > The sustainable notion of feedback fits well with Barnett and Coate’s (2005) view of the curriculum in higher education as deliberately designed to engage students, among others. They write of
      >> the imaginative design of spaces as such, spaces that are likely to generate new energies among students and inspire them, and so prompt their triple engagement – in knowing, acting and being. (3) [their italics]
      > Barnett and Coate are sceptical of ‘curricula rules and templates’ and of specifying ‘in advance the elements of every programme of study’ (2005, 3). We see the suggestions for feedback here as illustrations of many ways in which the ideas they contain can be manifested, not as the only ways in which they could or should be manifested.
    * It is only through taking a curriculum perspective, which is broader than a learning view or an assessment view, that feedback can be adequately located. Such a view enables feedback to be repositioned away from its taken for granted role as a feature of the ways teachers act towards students, towards being seen as an attribute of the curriculum that locates it as a central feature of student engagement. Feedback becomes therefore a key curriculum space for communicating, for knowing, for judging and for acting. It is not something that teachers do, any more than it is something students do: it is a necessary characteristic of any given curriculum, the effectiveness of which is a key indicator of the effectiveness of the whole course of study.

    * > the greatest predictor of enhanced student marks (on the assessment task that was the subject of the experiment), was the development of their ability to judge standards of performance on student work created in response to a similar task. The intervention took just 50 minutes indicating a good educational return on the pedagogical investment.
    * > creating an emphasis on a meta-dialogue about assessment, its purposes and how it functions. A further implication is that gains typically attributable to formative feedback could be enhanced not by a more detailed explication of the feedback by lecturers but rather by deploying assessment literacy (judgement)-enhancing protocols at the formative feedback points during the semester.
    * > Although the gains in student marks were modest in this case, the intervention was extremely brief, just 50 minutes. It is the potential leverage of the development of the ability to judge standards that makes it worthwhile considering incorporating these kinds of assessment literacy-developing protocol into regular teaching practice. In this study the gain was a 10% increase in the marks (approximately 2 in 20) on the task to which the protocol applied.

Formative assessment is more effective steaming/setting
* [Inside the Black Box](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/003172171009200119) (Black and Wiliam, 1998) [alternate](https://weaeducation.typepad.co.uk/files/blackbox.pdf)
    * Present policy treats the classroom like a _black box_ and offers no help with as to how to raise attainment. Inputs are money, teachers, resources. Outputs are grades. Whats happens inside the black box?
    * > Feedback to any pupil should be about the particular qualities of his or her work, with advice on what he or she can do to improve, and should avoid comparisons with other pupils
    * > For formative assessment to be productive, pupils should be trained in self-assessment so that they can understand the main purposes of their learning and thereby grasp what they need to do to achieve
    * > Opportunities for pupils to express their understanding should be designed into any piece of teaching, for this will initiate the interaction whereby formative assessment aids learning
    * > The dialogue between pupils and a teacher should be thoughtful, reflective, focused to evoke and explore understanding, and conducted so that all pupils have an opportunity to think and to express their ideas
    * > Tests and homework exercises can be an invaluable guide to learning, but the exercises must be clear and relevant to learning aims. The feedback on them should give each pupil guidance on how to improve, and each must be given opportunity and help to work at the improvement

        * > The big mistake that Paul and I made was calling this stuff “assessment”… because when you use the word assessment, people think about tests and exams’ (Stewart, 2012). He later commented that it should probably have been called something like ‘responsive teaching’ (Wiliam, 2013b).
* [Dylan William: What do we mean by Assessment for Learning?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-myBw36_DA) 9min 2018
    * Research suggests consistent effects
    * "Assessment of learning" helps teacher - not learner
    * focusing on the intention rather than the action.
    * "Assessment for learning" strategy by the government is all about recording and reporting achievement - if the impact is not with the student then it's not having an effect
    * > Formative assessment == Such assessment becomes formative  when the evidence is actually used to adapt the teaching work to meet the learning needs (Black 2002)
    * Short term - In the moment - impact before they leave the classroom
    * > Changing what teaching think doesn't benefit students until it changes what teachers do
      > ... we've been trying to get teachers to think there way into a new way of acting. We need teachers to act their way into a new way of thinking
    * Aspects of formative assessment

|       | Where is the learner going | Where the learner is | How to get there |
|-------|----------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Teacher | Clarify and share learning intentions | Engineering effective discussions, tasks, and activities that elicit evidence of learning | providing feedback that moves learners forward |
| Peer | Understand and share the learning intentions | Activating students are learning resources for one another |
| Learner | Understand the learning intentions | Activating students as owners of their own learning |
* cont ...
    * Activating students as owners of their own learning
        * Self assessment
        * Meta cognition
        * Emotional response (resilience to difficulties/failure)
        * Self efficacy
    * Activating students are learning resources for one another

        * Mentoring
    * Providing feedback that moves learners forward
        * often the view from the rear view mirror - what was wrong with the last assignment - but they are never going to do that assignment again
        * Feedback should take out of the last assignment, what they need for the next assignment
    * How often should we do formative assessment - not more than once per minuet

    * If you don't think you can get better you will reject feedback
    * Create a culture where teachers want to improve - not because they are not good enough
    * Schools are talent refinery's - some kid get it, some kid don't - the good are sifted to the top.
    * Talent incubators or talent factories
    * IQ is 80% of GCSE grade - IQ inhabitability 60%
    * Because it is the case - does not mean it ort to be the case
    * If you get a bell curve - you are not doing your job. A bell curve is what nature gives us
    * I don't want to live in a world where taller people are better at basketball
    * I don't believe in equality of opportunity - because that means the bell curve all over again. We need to give more help to the kids that need it
    * Send all the clever kids home on Thursday/Friday - that will close the achievement gap
    * Lower achieving pupils need a better chance of a good life
    * Consider control/impact matrix
        * some things are outside of your control and have high impact - _poverty_
    * Set's don't seem to impact on achievement - it's not an argument about data, the data is clear - it's about what middle class parents want
    * Some teachers are better than other teacher - so we drive teacher accountability - let's grade teachers - most people cant identify good teachers
    * More struggle more learning - less struggle less learning
    * 7 teachers
        * 3 have performed 0.5 standard deviations above consistently for 3 years
        * 4 have performed 0.5 standard deviations below consistently for 3 years
        * People shown video clips and asked to say good/bad teacher
        * nobody could tell (Strong 2011) - a coinflip was better odds - school principles, mentors, students, parents
    * You need 11 years worth of data to get an estimate predictor of how good a teacher is
    * We have better things to do with our time. There is no upside to grading teachers. Let's stop. Let's just help every teacher get better
    * How can you improve teachers if you cant measure them
    * Pareto 80:20 rule
        * Don't raise money for tax's until you can be sure you are doing the best you can with your current money
        * If have to take away from one thing to add to another - that's a political decision
        * If you can add to something without taking away from another - that's a technical matter and you should do it straight away
        * Can we improve education without adding more money?
        * If anything that you add damages what you have - then you are pareto optimal and only more money will improve it

    * Expertise is 
        * Specific and limited
        * Weakly related to general ability
        * Not reproducible to propositional knowledge - cant be reduced to words
        * Involves perception fo meaningful patters
    * Most teachers could be as good as the very best teachers within 10 years
    * You could have the very best school - it will just take you 10 years
    * In a collaborative environment teachers reach average of 1.0 in 3 years, in an average school this take teachers 7 years
    * Takeuchi 1995 - companies that manage tacit knowledge well - socialisation of staff
    * You get given advice - you sort of do it but don't really understand it until you were doing it yourself
* [Q&A with Dylan Wiliam at Embedding Formative Assessment SSAT/EEF Celebration Event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPTZpLaJvUA) 2017 1h15min
    * Schools are hyper optimised - everything you do is valuable - so improving education is hard - you can only improve it by stopping people doing good things so that they can do better things - teachers resist change because the things they are doing are good and needed - it's not laziness that _not everything gets marked_
    * SLT should not be advising in breakout groups - they are too detached - they change the dynamic, they are not the ground workers
        * Theory X - people are lazy and leaders need to monitor
        * Theory Y - people are ok and just need support
        * Better to start the conversation with Theory Y - turns out just asking most people to do their best is a pretty good strategy
        * If the metric is just make sales - that's easy - sell everything at a loss and boost sales ... but that's not what we want, we actually want is profit. 
        * We need corporate alignment. Cascaded objectives (OKRs based on OKRs) - direct reports had objectives that are aligned with theirs. 
        * Everybody made/succeeded in their objectives but the organisation did not get better/more-efficient
            * You MUST fail some of your objectives, otherwise they are not challenging enough.
        * there are no _experts_ in the group - equality of communication
    * A good teacher on their first day will be better than an average teacher after 20 years in the classroom
        * right now teachers are born, because we are not very good at making them
        * High IQ chess players improve in first few years but hit wall of experience. Sometimes the only way to progress is experience
        * Aim to reduce the variation in teacher quality
    * Effective & scaleable teacher professional development
        * better teachers are better, but it's impractical and expensive to replace the whole teacher workforce.
        * It's clear you have to invest in the teachers you've got
    * Formative assessment independent of any curriculum
    * Formative assessment is needed because children do not learn what we teach
    * The most important factor is what the learner already knows. Ascertain this and teach accordingly.
    * "You should know this you're in year 5" ... how do you get into year 5 ... be in year 4 and have a birthday
    * High priest of the spreadsheet - worship it and it would predict
    * Formative assessment is very subject specific
    * Don't ever take in input from one volunteer - at minimum get them to discuss. Every person is active
    * Hold hand up and wait for silence
    * ask everyone to vote with fingers 1,2,3,4,5
    * responsiveness
    * Factors with most difference - 1. high socioeconomic status 2. teacher responsive instruction (formative assessment)
    * Least difference - exploration learner (because teachers probably do it badly). absence.
    * 'Area of Tapesium' 43:00 - introduce one method + formula - then in groups find all other ways
        * https://youtu.be/aPTZpLaJvUA?t=2580
        * couple be useful in computing (how many ways of doing this)
            * one of these methods uses while loops - or uses a stack
        * teacher can 'ramp up' difficulty by prompts during the activity
    * Good teaching looks like - Big question - student discussion - teacher lead - students consolidating
        * setting doesn't work - we get 50% of kid in the right set
    * Lesson Study 50:00 - no guarantee this will help
    * Genuine Peer observation of lessons - no SLT - nothing formerly recorded - teacher request - genuinely formative 52:00
        * Skip the formal assessment, just get to 'things that matter'
    * Don't solve problems that there is no guarantee these will improve learning
        * 4 domains of practice - 2 domains don't matter
        * Teachers can get better at stuff that doesn't matter
    * Stop talking about comment only marking - all engagement and response is more important
    * only 3% can get the top grade (? not overly useful for universities or anyone)
    * Growth mindset is good for saying "you will be more able in this area if you put in effort" - higher achievement not higher intelligence
    * 01:12:20 "You have to have slack to do formative assessment"
    * The thinking capacity of novices and experts is the same. Experts can draw on long term memory

> Why am I doing your marking?

Teachers time is 100% full. There is nothing that teachers do that is 'not useful'. To make progress we need to prove that doing X is more effective than doing Y. You need to replace something with something more effective. https://youtu.be/7ynsMwzsCsg?t=2840

### Feedback

Student survey "Was your feedback helpful"

* What is it? Can you define it?
    * Communicating how they can improve the quality of their work

* Good feedback
    * Timely
    * Facilitate self assessment
    * Delivers high quality information about their learning
    * encourages teacher and peer dialogue
    * Encourages positivity and self-esteem
    * Helps close the gap between current and desired performance
    * provides valuable information to teachers
        * To improve delivery?
    * How is feedback used?
        * Direct instruction
        * Reflective practice
        * 1 to 1 discussion?
        * 'Feed forward' targeting specific areas for improvement
        * Develops students "appraisal expertise"
        * Include students in the process
            * If feedback is _one way_ students don't take it in. Actively engage students with the feedback.
        * Constructive rather than descriptive
            * Just praising does not help growth mindset
                * "Praise makes you feel good, critique makes you better"
        * Something they got right can be built on
    * Anonymous marking
        * The marker does not have any identifying aspects of the students
    
* Bad feedback

* Principles of assessment design (Gibbs and Simpson, 2004)
    * Number of assessments should be proportional to the amount of study time and love
    * Assessment demands should be designed/communicated so students can allocate time/effort
    * Assessment should engage students in producing learning activity of an appropriate kind
    * Sufficient feedback needs to be provided, both often and in enough detail
    * Feedback should focus on students performance and actions the students can control
    * Timely (the feedback should still matter)
    * Feedback needs to match the grade
    * Feedback need to be actionable

Why are you here?
[Teachers' Standards](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/665522/Teachers_standard_information.pdf)

* Help mould young people to be lifelong learners, passionate, self worth, collaborative, community driven human beings

* Can't rely on teachers opinion - no standardisation
* Baseline for comparison across departments/schools/county's
* Evidence based rather than opinion based

* You observe the students - you already know - you know them - you work with 1000's of kids with years of experience. You know. But you need evidence.

* IQ of 86 - Minimum bar for military
    * Under this number there is not a single task that can be given to the individual that is not counter productive.
    * 10% of the population

* Governments 'Value added': +/- from predicted attainment
    * Take Sats (english/maths) estimate IQ
    * Take entire country's GCSE results.
    * Derive average expected GCSE attainment (year 11) from sats (year 7)
    * Apply this derived heuristic to next years cohort (or loosely any future cohort at any yeargroup stage)
* All teachers/departments are ranked in every school.
    * Whether you're told or not; you are ranked.
    * Take a single student
    * Average all their other GCSE's
    * Compare their GCSE average against your subjects attainment +/-
    * Sort the list

* When dealing with averages on this scale, no excuse matters
    * One student had XYZ so they attained poorly. Well averages state another student did better than expected. The world is even. The excuse that a whole class is 'rotten' doesn't hold up against the averages. The weak link is you.

* Schools want this standardised assessment
* Parents want this standardised assessment
* Government's want this standardised assessment

* Teachers in different schools suffer different burdens
    * Ghrama school teachers stating their two level 4's are shameful (one was a school refuser, one had learning difficulty's. The result is still abounding!)
    * Comprehensive school teachers would be overjoyed at 38% of a class attaining level 4

* Cambels law - Any system with a measurable metric is gamed.
* Anything that you do that is not directly related to GCSE metrics (or open evening perception) is pointless.
* SMT Don't know or care.
* If you're _nice_ but don't produce results you'll be seen as a weak practitioner.

* Cash cash cash
    * A-Level class
    * 16 students
    * All predicted E's (because you cant be preicted U's because there is no point in sitting the course)
        * Most students only got 4 GCSE's (in ICT that was 100% coursework), so they take ICT A-Level or Computing A-Level as it' the only foundation skill on paper they have competence in.
    * If they are all predicted U's is this the best choice for this student?
    * Who care's if it's good for the student; every bum on a seat is raw cash baby!!!

* Education is a business
* Welcome to the factory

Every Teacher knows the system is not sufficient - let's not re-enforce that - let's find solutions

Many people have advised governments against this and opinion/process is positively changing
David Didau and Dylan Wiliam + MANY more are inspiring national change


Invisible Curriculum - Character Traits
---------------------------------------

* Draw a picture of a horse as accurately as possible - you will be marked on proportions, feature accuracy, detail - show publicly (5 min)
* Outside (change lesson)
* Write a 3 line poem about Computing. You have (5 min)

Imagine being placed under somebody else's control every 60 minuets and asked to do something that you can't do and then display it publicly and constantly compare you to your peers.

Activity: Why are you here? (Refer to the teacher standards)

* "Everybody is a genius but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live the rest of it's whole life thinking it's stupid" (Albert Einstein)
* "There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men. True nobility lies in being superior to your former self" (Anthony Moore)
* Ken Robinson's Story - Mary - Year 3 - Cold breaktime - drawing God - 'nobody knows what god looks like' - 'they will in a minuet miss' - then the lesson starts, robbed of that freedom.

* The first step is to measure whatever can be easily measured. This is ok as far as it goes.
* The second step is to disregard that which can't be measured or give it an arbitrary quantitative value. This is artificial and misleading.
* The third step is to presume that what can't be measured easily really isn't very important. This is blindness.
* The forth step is to say that that which can't be easily measured really doesn't exist.
(Blatchford 2014)

Activity: Discuss:Some schools ask for an attainment and effort grade? what do you think??

ITT Core Framework
6.4
> pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect
6.5
> High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve
6.6
> Over time, feedback should support pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning.


#### Assessment Criteria -> Peer/Self Assessment

Activity: "Pupils a can identify a range of web page design features and can explain why the designer has chosen to use them for the target audience"

Publish your assessment criteria
Show examples of good/bad work
They now know + can peer self assess

You see 300+ students a week - you dont have a chance of marking it

Advantages of peer assessment
* stepping stone for self assessment
* less threatening than teacher
* more honest (brutal)
* language more relatable
* more likely to interrupt rather than continue listening to teacher
* different approach angle than teacher


#### Questioning Techniques

Questioning is a form of assessment.

hands up
targeted
pair share
  snowball
round robin
expert groups
Jigsaw (different groups, different questions)
individual whiteboards
Opinion line

Questioning 1-to-1 to assess understanding

Question to diagnose

Tracking
--------

* [OCR Assessment Resources](https://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/gcse/computer-science-j276-from-2016/assessment/)
    * OCR Project tracking sheet

* Transparency - Available to everyone? - Data protection
* See who's falling behind
* Setting targets
* Tracking should be available to you, students, department - How?

* Students should have a habit of evidence gathering - the process is more important than the outcome

* Dictaphone? - how to archive/store? catalog? transcribe?

Activity:
* What data will you track for a class?
* How often?
* How will this data help
    * you? (accountability)
    * students?
    * department?
* How will you track it?
    * Spreadsheet
    * SIM's Software (ubertrack for smt impractical for everyday use)

Lambert and Lines (2000) describe how teachers fall into an 'Accountability Trap' where they see there own tracking systems as being used to 'prove' their competence.


### 'Cover your ass' case study

* Every practical focused A-Level lesson. Sat one-to-one with student. These are the deadlines you've missed. These are the attainments of your current work. Conversation recorded in database. Key points for improvement. New deadlines for missing work. weekley log of everything agreed with student. They know they have work that is 3 weeks late a letter will be sent home.
* Near end of year a student realised they were really really really behind. Made a sob story about how they were not supported properly and it was the school/teachers fault. Parent goes on warpath. Calls meeting with Head of 6th form and Head of Department and Teacher. Parent ready for a fight. Teacher puts down 5 sheets of A4 with every conversation with the student over the year documented. Multiple letters sent home that 'never got there'. Student frog marched out of room.
* NO Student. However good your rapport with, is your friend. They will turn on you. Your department will turn on you. The only defence you will ever have is assessment evidence and records. They are your lifeline. ALWAYS keep good records.

Good Kids in Poor schools

Are not harmed.
Makes me consider the reality of how much impact schools actually have.
The most important thing is 'igniting the spark of passion' in young people. The _system_ is not the reason we exist.

Summative/Formative Assessment
------------------------------

* Summative
    * focus is on the outcome
    * gcse result, grade, number
    * no meaningful feedback
* Formative
    * > Any assessment that helps a pupil to learn and develop is formative (Perrenoud) 1991
    * facilitates the participants development
        * corrects a misconception
    * suggestions for improvement, questioning, verbal feedback, self evaluation, peer assessment

Ofsted (historically) wanted to ask students:
* What grade/level are you currently at
* What is there next step. How to improve
    * Target setting is a formalised for of feedback - specific and challenging
    * Short term and long term goals are required to make progress

ITT Core Framework
6.1
> Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and needs
6.2
> Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear
