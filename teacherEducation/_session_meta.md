    * can't use a keyboard
    * not going to be software engineers
* NCCE guest (diversity)
* Subject Knowledge
    * Opportunity to take GCSE


### How is the curriculum sequenced for my subject?

* SP1 - Breath and rigour of PCK
    * Early on in the course, students are unaware of the depth of the discipline
* SP2 - (PGCE) Academic writing + research
* SP3 - National Curriculum + Literacy + Digital Literacy + Progression models (KS3->KS4->KS5)
    * What is the computing curriculum in secondary schools and how do they link together
* SP4 - (PGCE) Micro-teach
    * PGCE has not been in school and need practical practice
* SP5 - Learning Theories + Meta-cognition
    * Theories underpinning learning (how do these concepts aid planning)
* SP6 - Computing Pedagogies
    * Examples of ways of dissecting/delivering Computing (context: see broad and balanced)
* SP7 - Behaviour/Motivation
    * Now students are standing up in front of class's and have an idea of the subject content, they almost universally struggle with the practical engagement with class's. This session supports them
* SP8 - (PGCE) Mental Models + Computational Thinking
    * Academic look at knowledge categorisation
* SP9 - Questioning + Formative Assessment
    * The first half of the mechanics of teacher are planning and basic delivery with meaningful tasks. Next we tackle assessment to ascertain how effective the activities have actually been
* SP10 - Assessment for Learning
    * Explore meaningful feedback
* SP11 - Tech for Teaching Computing
    * Physical (Microbit), Automated Testing/Marking
* SP12 - (ePortfolio)
* SP13 - (PGCE) Inclusion
    * Students can teach in front of a class and can assess gaps in student understanding. How do we now taylor and include everyone.
* SP14 - (PGCE) Primary + Unplugged
* SP15 - Differentiation
    * Ensuring planning caters/targets/identifies all learners
* SP16 - Broad and Balanced (cross curricular)
    * Computing is meaningless without context - Computing must be taught alongside community/world/real context
* SP17 - (ePortfolio)
* SP18 - KS5
    * Range of options at KS5 and the content (progression of own skills)
* SP19 - Risk Taking
    * Ready to break the mechanical mold and explore new ideas
* SP20 - (PGCE) Impact + Data

### How are fundamental maths and English skills addressed in Computing?​

* SP3 highlights technical language and how this is required for students to even think in their discipline. These key themes run through planning as technical language should be identified in all lessons.
* Constructing algorithms requires understanding of operations (mathematical). Computing is maths.
* Meta-cognition - discussed manifesting meaningful reflections

### Why is it sequenced in this way? 

Students cant digest all concepts at once. The sequence is graduated to roughly 
What is Computing -> what do you deliver (planning) -> how do you deliver (computing + behaviour) -> How do you know anything you've taught has worked? (assessment) -> how do we ensure everyone is making progress? (inclusion/differentiation) -> how do we explore/experiment new ideas (broader context + ks5)


### How is your subject curriculum integrated with placement?​ (How are Placement and CCCU sessions integrated in my subject?)

* Start of session - describe Mentor lead foci and how it relates to this session (Curriculum guidance document)
* 1 target each week related to curriculum foci
* Weekley Bulletin (has the foci) mentors and students
    * Drip feed - ongoing

* two way
    * Flip the script - Student tutorials for recognising meaningful targets


### How does the structure of your subject curriculum prepare students for a career in teaching?​

* It supports the foundations/mechanics and ends by emphasising exploration/experimentation/creativity/risks/breath
* Students should be critical and reflective
    * I often quote "We need to see focus targets and reflections leading to actions - if you are in the habit of doing this, we can be confident that when you are on your own in your ECT year, you have the mindset and skills to purposefully refine your teaching"
* Value fellow (computing) peer support into their carer

### As a subject leader, how do you support your subject mentors?​

Mentors change every year
* 2 face-to-face visits a year
    * discuss targets
    * Identify things and report that to SAL
    * Observe (not required but), debrief, how they convey to students
* Wider mentor training
    * Online or face-to-face
* Subject specific face-to-face training (twice a year)
    * Target discussions
    * Wider Computing mentor groups
* Online booking system for quick remote one-to-ones

* Some Subject mentors have been previous students
* Build Personal Relationship

Bulletin (mentors and students) key readings



### How are you assessing your students?​

* Seen all of my trainees teach by performing joint observation and debrief with mentor during visits

#### How are you monitoring their progress?​

* ePortfolios are formally inspected 4 times a year
    * Targets are SMART and have actions (weekley)
    * SPR (longer term targets have manifest-able goal)
* Starter of weekley university section (20min)
    * Pair - discuss targets and experience - ePortfolio targets on screen - rotate partners each week
    * Tutor circulate - pickup themes from discussion - inspect ePortfolio targets passively (raising questions if needed)

### Who are your stronger students? Who are the weaker ones? How do you know this?​

* Many of my students are insecure about their subject knowledge and are working towards KS4 knowledge
    * Some students have had this identified by their schools before beginning the course. Some have organised time in other schools to bolster this
    * After actively attempting some GCSE passed papers - are building understanding of the topics
* Observed from computing session activities
    * Verbal presentation of algorithm (sorting)
    * Pair programming
    * Practical Network activities (some struggled to read a diff)
* Individual folder tutorials
    * PPD Day
    * SPR reviews

### Extra: How do you go above and beyond in the delivery of your subject curriculum?​	

! oh .. more ..

* GCSE with Barton Court 
* Outreach work with Department of Computing (practical activities), STEM Hub days - AI in curriculum
* Upcoming ChatGTP to plan lessons and scrutinise them - how students can harness this technology



How do you know your mentors are good
* Trainee feedback SPEF
* Visits + early imrpessions
* SAL + PM
* eportfolio
* Deselect


TODO:
What CPD do I do as a subject specialist to know I am sufficient
NCCE certificates
Trained facilitator
Conferences


Ambisious Curricum
* Involve mentors in planning from visit 2!!!!!
* REE (cross curricular) + SP (literature and reflection - prep for HOD in 5 years - plant the seeds) above just being in classroom
* What have our trainees gone on to do? be? contribute? ECT?
* KS5? (umbrella of secondary) - SEND (SEN WEEK), key stages, settings, school context (coastal, inner ciy, rural) - holistic in nature - Contrasting placement in kent gives huge range - Teach in ANY school!!! 
    * TODO: design with course/school parteners
* PPD - days - gp day -
