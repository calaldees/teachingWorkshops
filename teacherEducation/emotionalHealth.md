    * > @CajunMSTeacher: Apparently I upset some people with my post about not bringing work home. I’m sorry, but this ongoing acceptance by teachers that we’re supposed to work 60+ hours a week because we love our jobs is why we’re in the position we’re in. Stop letting it be acceptable. Force change.
        * > @fatbadger442: Do you give children homework? If so, you do know that all you are doing is modelling unpaid overtime, don't you? Do you oppose children's excessive workloads that impinge upon time at home as much as you do teachers'?
        * > @CajunMSTeacher: I’ve already adressed this twice, but I’ll say it again. I do not assign hw for my students. It would be a double standard for me to give them work and then say I shouldn’t have to work at home. I structure my classes so that they hve time needed to complete everything in class.
        * > @MrsLansdell: But I just don’t understand how to do this. I’ve been teaching 25+ years. I cannot get everything done without either staying late or taking work home. If I don’t, I don’t have everything ready and I HAVE to have it ready to go for kindergarten. I’m the one who suffers.
        * > @jenlowejohnson: We talk about leaving work at work frequently in the Teacher Care Network Support Community. If we want teacher retention to improve, we have to stop acting like it's normal to work that much for so little money. Teachers are humans with human needs, one of them being rest.
