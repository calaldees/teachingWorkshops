* [The Four C Model of Creativity](https://www.waldenu.edu/online-masters-programs/ms-in-education/resource/the-four-c-model-of-creativity) Kaufman  2009
    * Mini C - any attempt at new task (meaningful/value to learner)
    * Little C - might be of value to others
    * Pro C - professional value
    * Big C (Einstein) - value to the world

        * TODO! Massive! Loads of references. Compares measures of creativity. This looks like gold!


* [Do Schools Kill Creativity](https://www.ted.com/talks/sir_ken_robinson_do_schools_kill_creativity) TED 2006 Sir Ken Robinson 18min
    * 72 million views - ULTRA popular
    * Education takes them into a future you can't grasp
    * All kids have tremendous talents and we squander them
    * Creativity should be treated with the same status as literacy
    * "Nobody knows what god looks like" - "they will in a minuet"
    * We get educated out of creativity

* Autonomy over - academic railroad
    * We are teaching things that students are not interested in
* non completion hierarchy wars
* how do you make it less hierarchical

lunchtime? what are the other professionals doing?

* From [The Voices of Solution Tree](https://slideplayer.com/slide/3762685/) - 2011 Dylan Wiliam
    * Example Course (Slide 32)
        * Weeks 1 to 2
            * Individual choice from a range of work provided by the teacher.
            * Student self-assessment using materials provided
        * Weeks 3 to 6
            * Children construct own problems like those in weeks 1 and 2 and select structured math apparatus to aid solutions
        * Weeks 7 to 10
            * Children presented with a new learning objectives, and make up their own problems, without exemplars by the teacher
        * Weeks 11 to 14
            * Children set their own learning objectives, construct appropriate problems, and use appropriate self-assessment
        * Weeks 15 to 20
            * As weeks 1 to 14, but with less monitoring from the teacher and increased freedom of choice and personal responsibility
    * WHAT? .. is this grounded in reality? Many adults can't do this?
        * But Dylan has taught maths in central London schools. Does he know something we don't?



### Escape room idea

Disclaimer.
We are time bound.
You may only have 1 hour of KS3 a week. 
To do a project like this you may need a significant investment in time. 
This may be too much for your current SOW and KS3 program. 
This is a _possible concept_ it is not a fully formed or trailed idea.


* Demo the concept of an escape room.
    * Show videos? Bring in equipment? Bring in a guest speaker? Enthuse them.
* Introduce project
    * Individually or in pairs
        * Design and create the code for an escape room puzzle that uses a microbit
            * When a code is entered - unlock a box
            * When a door is opened trigger something
            * Might be a scrambled message on paper that if they match the symbols on paper to the microbit they can decode the message
            * (The goal is not to actually build it thematically visibly, you may create the electronics physically)
        * Consider partnering with 2 other groups to create a theme
            * Haunted house
            * Derelict spaceship
            * Egyptian tomb
    * Assessment criteria
        * Be clear your assessment is of _use of Computing skills_ rather than artwork created to go with the puzzle
        * use of external input
            * buttons sensor
            * relay/magnet
        * use of external output
            * speaker
            * motor
            * magnetic latch
            * led
        * use of radio communication
            * describe the protocol
            * Transmission? Error handling? Ack?
        * use of a loop
        * use of storage
            * array?
        * use blocks
        * use code
            * code only features
        * collaboration with other teams - protocol design? hardware integration with others
        * marks for puzzle concept
    * Support materials
        * List of basic project suggestions
            * Some weaker students will not no where to start. Give them a choice of three possible achievable simple projects
                * Cycle led's through a pattern. The puzzle is to press the button when the LED's are in a particular arrangement. The arrangement could be found by decoding a message on paper.
        * Setup a class wiki for the project
        * Some links to some more advanced tools
            * Links to Youtube videos? other tutorials/resources? on how to use a depth-sensor?
        * Record a video of you creating a starting project that demos the core skills (could be done live in class and recorded)
    * Assessment could be
        * Video of a them describing to other/students how it works
        * A poster describing how it works
        * Annotated code with comments mapped to assessment criteria
    * Demo at open evening?

Creativity Conundrum

I don't know how to do this

    * Situated learning was proposed by Lave and Wenger (1991), who stated that learning is a psychological process of individual meaning construction and a participatory process of surrounding situations. Learning situations are the key to stimulating learners’ internal and external learning motivations and to enabling learners to transform abstract perceptions into concrete thinking (Clancey, 1995)

    * > The field of artificial (general) intelligence has made no progress because there is an unsolved philosophical problem at its heart: we do not understand how creativity works (David Deutsch)
    *  the definitions (of creativity) are very informal, given in a natural language, 
    *  the definitions (of creativity) hardly ever mention the term knowledge
    *  > “actually creating new knowledge or combining existing fragments of knowledge in altogether new ways (Mokyer)
    *  > The classical view (of computation) favors the view of HOW computations are performed, instead of WHAT they are doing
    *  cognition is knowlege generation
    *  > Can we be more specific in describing which knowledge generating processes can be seen as creative processes? What are the prerequisites for computational creativity?
    * "analogy solving" is elementary creativity (and measurable?)
        * > Solving an analogy can be seen as an elementary creativity act that calls for discovering and displaying new relations between known pieces of knowledge
        * You need understanding of multiple topics/domains/systems to link them together
    * > “analogy is a figure of language that expresses a set of like relations among two sets of terms
    * analogies create understanding between something unknown by relating it to something known
    * Logically and formally - objects that have more relations are prefered (see section 3.2 of article for :shark:🐫 :desert-lion example)
    * > 'taxonomy' dealing with classification of things or concepts based on sharing similar features
    * > A 'metaphor' is an expression of language that describes a subject by comparing it with another unrelated subject resembling the original subject only in some semantic aspects
        * e.g. > "time is money"
    * > Allegories are typically used as literary devices or rhetorical devices that convey hidden meanings through symbolic figures, actions, imagery, and/or events, which together create the moral, spiritual,or political meaning the author wishes to convey
    * Syntactic knowledge mining (traditional AI - searching for patterns in known data/knowlege)
    * Semantic knowledge mining
        * is the main engine of creativity.
        * is formed in a natural language ... This complicates the searches since the meaning of linguistic terms must be known. The meaning of each term is, in fact, a piece of knowledge
        * calls for detecting similarities between theories usually related to different knowledge domains
    * Unfortunately, general mechanisms of semantic knowledge discovery, explanations and understanding are largely unknown
    * >  creative process is not a special type of computation to begin with but a whole collection of computations as also seen from the schema of resolving explanatory analogies
    * > the larger the knowledge base the greater the potential for discovering new knowledge ... and the creative agent must have a command of natural language  in order to be able to navigate among various knowledge domains
