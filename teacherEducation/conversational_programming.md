Conversational Programming
--------------------------

Considering cognitive load

* Conversational Programmers
    * Conversational Programmers (High level patterns - in blocks)
    * Build working program in chunked examples
    * (Kind of like my engineering projects - [chat project python/js](https://github.com/calaldees/TeachProgramming/tree/master/teachprogramming/static/docs) - felt success - felt real world)

            * Conversational programmers want to learn about code primarily to communicate with technical co-workers, not to develop software. 
            * However, existing instructional materials don’t meet the needs of conversational programmers because they prioritize syntax and semantics over concepts and applications. 
            * This mismatch results in feelings of failure and low self-efficacy
