Important Subjects?
-------------------

Let's get some perspective - where does Computing fit in?

DISCUSS: Verbally Justify why each of these subjects is important
* English
* Maths
* RE
* Physics
* Chemistry
* Biology
* Geography
* History
* DT
* PE
* Social Science
* Business Studies
* Drama

and now

* Computing

We are a tiny part of something much bigger.
Our subject may seem insignificant. Or it may be the most important of all.
Which is it?


Or maybe there are no subjects? They are just a societal construct?

What subjects are studied at Eton?
Which would you choose for a curriculum?



What is the National Curriculum? (15min)
--------------------------------

The subjects have been chosen by government policy.

* [Curriculum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum) Wikipedia
    * > Curriculum is broadly defined as the totality of student experiences that occur in the educational process.
    * > The term often refers specifically to a planned sequence of instruction, or to a view of the student's experiences in terms of the educator's or school's instructional goals

The entire roadmap for state education. THE National Curriculum

* [Statutory guidance - National curriculum in England: framework for key stages 1 to 4](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-framework-for-key-stages-1-to-4/the-national-curriculum-in-england-framework-for-key-stages-1-to-4) 2014
    * NC is just one part of a schools curriculum
    * Computing is a Foundation subject
    * Most schools follow tend to follow the NC even if they are academies
    * Academies/Public/Private/Independent don't need to teach computing
        * local.gov.uk [Number of secondary academies as a percentage of all secondary schools in England](https://lginform.local.gov.uk/reports/lgastandard?mod-area=E92000001&mod-group=AllRegions_England&mod-metric=6599&mod-type=namedComparisonGroup)
            * South East 74% of secondary schools are academies

TASK: Read the National Curriculum (10min) Make notes in shared document about the things you as a Computing teacher need to actively engage with.
(5min summary with class)



National Curriculum - Computing (30min)
---------------------------------------

[./whatIsComputing.md](./whatIsComputing.md)

### What is Computing? (20min)

* [National Curriculum: computing programmes of study](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study) 2013
    * The opening line ... is majestic!
    * > A high-quality computing education equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world.

TASK: Read it ... (5min) ... first impressions (5min)?


* [Fulford School: What is Computing](https://fulford.york.sch.uk/computing/) P. Dring
    * 82% of all job vacancies require digital skills
    * Roles requiring digital skills pay 29% more than those that don’t
    * In recent years, the number of digital jobs grew almost three times as quickly as other occupations
    * 3 strands
        * Computer Science (CS)
            * involves understanding how computers work and how to use them to solve problems with algorithms and code.
        * Information Technology (IT)
            * involves processing data and using a variety of hardware & software to create digital media that is suitable for different audiences and purposes.
        * [Digital Literacy](./digitalLiteracy.md) (DL)
            * involves understanding how to use technology safely, respectfully, responsibly and securely

TASK: Look at the National Curriculum and categorise the points into the table below (pairs?) (10min)

* [National curriculum in England: computing programmes of study](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study#key-stage-3)

ANSWERS: As a group, Let's compare against CAS allocations - where are your misunderstandings?

</details>


### Is the National Curriculum out of date? (10min)

The NC was written in 2013. Computing moves so fast, does it need to be re-written?
(If the answer is 're-write', would a single student have ever completed the NC from KS1 to KS4 == 12 years?)

TASK: Read the NC. Where could AI fit in? (Hint: It IS in there ... but where?)


Progression Model

Science Vs Engineering
----------------------

* [Computing Science or Engineering? Language](https://learn.canterbury.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-2641367-dt-content-rid-3959384_1/courses/E20MTETT4SPD/Is%20Computer%20Science%20a%20Science%20-%20Denning.pdf) Interview with Denning 2007
    * > Because computers are man-made and not natural. We can't study them like a science. People in other fields think we are just programmers. We've be unsuccessful in communicating the breath and depth of our discipline
* [Knowing versus Doing: Academic and Vocational Education for Informatics in the UK](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.103.7746&rep=rep1&type=pdf) Cowling 2000?
    * vocational (ie concerned with developing skills),
    * academic (ie concerned with developing knowledge) 
    * What if what we do needs both? These have converged.
    * > neither kind of course (academic or vocational) can be characterised simply in terms of equipping students with knowledge or skills.

    *   > The future looks to be interesting. 
        > Already there are rumblings that there are woefully small numbers of suitable graduates entering CS teacher training.
        > Even if the number were to rise substantially, 
        > it would take some years for expertise to be built and suggested syllabi to embed

* Most Computing teachers have not come from a Computing background. They have come from other subjects.
* 2014 All _ICT teachers_ in the country were told "You now teach Computing".
* The first GCSE computing students have been though university and are now entering the workforce 2021
    * (It's 2022 and I haven't seen any motion)

WE WON!! WE GOT COMPUTING ON THE CURRICULUM!
... but you know where this goes ... you've done the pre-reading ... there is a backlash

* BSC [The Roehampton annual computing education report](https://www.bcs.org/more/bcs-academy-of-computing/the-roehampton-annual-computing-education-report/) 2018
    * Statistics on GCSE computing across the country
    * Number are dropping
    * Time allocated is dropping




Friction with Society (30min)
---------------------

Pre-Reading Required

Is Computing misunderstood?
Has technology corrupted education?

Computing in the curriculum has been criticized for not being relevant for all students.

DISCUSS:
1. What are the points raised in these articles?
2. How do your personal beliefs as a _Teacher of Computing_ intersect with the opinions displayed in these articles?
* As a group you must self balance - I want you facilitate equal contributions from everyone



Preparing students for a future we are unsure of
------------------------------------------------

Our technology/society is changing fast

* [When landlines were considered dangerous - BBC Ideas](https://www.bbc.co.uk/ideas/videos/when-landlines-were-considered-dangerous/p08dwnnz) 7min Video
* > Low level coding jobs will be the first to go. Sysadmin, network architect, computer support. <sub>Rotten STEM</sub>

* [The role of beliefs in teacher agency](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13540602.2015.1044325) Gert Biesta 2015
    * > The comparative lack of a clear vision about what education is for seems to seriously limit the possibilities for action to develop a good education

TASK: From today's session. 
1. Reflect on "clear vision about what education is for"
2. Articulate how this will impact your teaching (actions/next-steps)
5min thinking/preparing.
Round-robin the group. 


Closing thoughts
----------------

### Access to information


* We dreamed of a future where everyone had access to information. It would liberate the working class's.
* We now have access ubiquitous to high quality information: YouTube, Learn-to-code resources, Wikipedia.
* Is the average person smarter, better informed, more skilled?
* The problem is not _access to information_.

Unsorted

### What are the expectations/misconceptions teaching Computer Science?

* "Young people are so good. All that clicking around so fast"
* "I'm not going to be a software developer this is pointless"

* Actually work with data
* as

More
* Perceptions of gender and ethnicity in Computing
