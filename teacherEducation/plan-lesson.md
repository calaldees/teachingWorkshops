Plan a lesson - concept (1.5 hours)
-----------------------

Are you ready for something cognately HARD ... so far you have been given information .. now it's time to generate it! You don't have enough experience to tackel this yet. It is just an introduction.

Anatomy of a lesson
* previous lesson
* Objectives (what do you want students to learn - not do)
* Entry + task routines?
* Keywords
* Outcome: All/Most/Some?
* Interventions: Indipendent/misconceptions,hurdles/not quite got the core concept
* Differenceiation: stretch the more able, support the weaker
* Transitions (How you move from one mode/task to the next)
* Check their understanding of the task + where the support is
* Plenary
* How will you know they have made progress?

write it, say it to peer, say it to me
hook, storytell
what did we learn last lesson
new material (heres one I made earlyer)
Saffolding and fading (when do you remove the support)

* Starter/Plenary?
    * [Mike Gershon - Resources for teachers](https://mikegershon.com/resources/) - free powerpoint on starters plenerys and afl tools
        * "The Starter Generator: KS2, KS3, KS4 Starters" + "Plenaries on a Plate"

* [Welcome to The 5 Minute Lesson Plan](https://www.teachertoolkit.co.uk/5minplan/)
    * A way of thinking about lessons
    * [5min Lesson Plan 2021](https://youtu.be/mBWK2AsnFjU?t=349) video 10min

TASK 1: 1 hour

* Pick a concept from the KS3 National Curriculum (Some topic ideas are listed below)
* Have a look at the "Lesson Planning Form"
    * [All Documentation (Padlet)](https://cccu.padlet.org/sharron_mackenzie1/nsp03wkvd1u5zx0z) Lesson Planning Form
    * Using the columns headings on page 2 - Can you put describe you 2 or 3 tasks

### Loose KS3 topics/Skills
* Fetch decode execute cycle (von neumann)
* decimal
* binary - counting - convert dec-to-bin (subtract or divide method) - nibble 4bit, byte 8bit, overflow
* lookups (morse code)
* text file size
* decomposition
* data to solution - fire escape plan
* shapes + algorithms
* sequence + iteration
* url structure
* typo-squatting
* content farms (high advert ratio)
* thin content
* trustworthy sources
* google page rank (personal, geo-location)
* and or not google search advanced
* html, headings, lists, images, styles (css)
* forms (validation)
* xml format checkers
* embeds
* interfaces gui, command line, gesture, voice
* closed/open questions
* app design, app development (would it be useful, what would users want, scope, ux priority)
* raster/vector images (bit-depth/res)
* stenography, cryptography, data corruption, data at end of image
* functions, parameters, if, comments
* generalisation (function) (e.g triangle, square, pentagon)
* random maths quiz
* application, kernel
* files folders (copy, move) command-line/gui wild-cards
* binary trees
* algorithms path-finding (scratch) (is color touching) maze
* and, or, not gates (truth tables)
* loops, for, while, forever
* router lan/wan wi-fi isp tcp/ip (layers, error correction) packet/circuit switched ip-address(bytes), dns, subnets, mac address
* bubble sort - selection sort - time
* data types (int, string, date, image, sound)
* compression - lossy
* random
* recursion (10 green bottles) fibonacci, golden ratio (nature)
* cypher history, substitution caesar (excel lookup), symbols (pigpen), transitional
* bin to dec, ascii, hex
* data -> information (database) recipe allergy - search, redundant/duplicated data, validation
* linear search, binary search - time-it
* web-form to database
* half adder - full adder - latch circuit (1bit)


### Feedback from group
I will use the razzle dazzle name randomiser to select presenters
```python
import random
names = ['bob', 'jane', 'sally']
print(names.pop(random.randrange(len(names))))
```
