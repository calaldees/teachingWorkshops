Chapter 13 by Vanessa Dye 'Reflection, reflection, reflection, I'm thinking all the time, why do I need a theory or model of reflection?', pp. 217-234 in  Developing Reflective Practice,  (2011), ed. Deborah McGregor & Lesley Cartwright. 

* "So how is 'reflection' different from the thinking I do anyway?"
* When we look in a mirror, we may be prompted to take some action to improve what we see, especially first thing in the morning.
* The process of becoming a reflective practitioner cannot be prescribed (Larrivee 2000)
* "reflecting, reflecting, reflecting I think all the time, don't I? What is it with this reflection thing that makes it so important?" (Ottensen 2007)
* We do not learn from experience. We learn from reflecting on experience. (Dewey 1933)
* Reflection 
    * has _direction_
    * Reflection combines practice and theory
        * A reflective practitioner will develop your own theories and models of teaching
* Journal
    * Keeping a journal helps to review experiences in a more formal way than just thinking about something. Writing about an experience may promote you to think more carefully, as explaining it and committing it to paper for someone else to understand means you have to revisit key events and think more deeply about them.
* SOS Model - Self, Others, Situation
* separate personal self from your professional self
* writing free from the police officer of your mind - need to be aware of the need for professional language. Your diary entries should be written for someone who can give you constructive and developmental support in building your skills
    * "Reflective practice seems to perpetuate the current policy climate in education, which is dominated by systems of surveillance. Though the process I have opened up my professions and to some extent personal identity to the scrutiny of not only peers but also tutors. In my experience this reduces the liberating element of reflection and replaces it with performance anxiety."
* Critical Incidents in Teaching: Developing Professional Judgement (Tripp 1993)

    * Something that made you stop and think
    * Relevant
        * Not necessarily serious or dangerous
        * Possibly something that happens _frequently_
    * e.g.
        * Two students repeatedly chatting/laughing in a lecture
        * Majority of students hadn't prepared for a session
        * Student explains to you why they haven't been able to engage with a learning resource you'd provided
        * You see a recording of yourself delivering a presentation and realise they you talk really quickly when you're nervous
* gain insight into bigger picture. This is when reflection overlaps with critical thinking (mezirow 1998, McGuinness 2005; McGregor 2007)

    * Reflection _in_ action (at the time the event is happening)
        * The experience itself
        * Deciding how to act at the time
    * Reflection _on_ action (after the event)
        * Thinking how to do things differently

#### Summary

Powerful reflection contains
* What (concise description)
* Why the incident mattered (So What)
* Other viewpoints (interpretation, feedback)
* Other approaches (theory, colleagues)
* Bias
* Awareness of reflective process (limitations)
* Actions / Future Changes
* Summary


### The Park (Example reflections)

#### Example 1
Not really a reflection. More of an account of the events. 
Mentioned 'upset' but did not dissect why.
Not focus on topic. Multiple thoughts ideas and memories that are irrelevant to the incident.

#### Example 2
Focused on the event with a description of the setting (how/why she was their).
Some identification of why the others had not acted.
Gave own personal reasons for not acting.
Manifestations of guilt but no direction of action.

#### Example 3
Sharp/brief description of what happened.
Much more focus on own feelings + asking why actions had/had-not been taken.
What could have been done differently
Questions personal identity 'I do not usually do wrong'
Further areas of life - linking to other related past experiences

#### Example 4
Breakdown of own thought process's
Own rational. why there was doubt, dressed? play acting?
Reconcile 'good person' with actions - am not always a good person
Consider possible bias's
Admit attitude nearly resulted in death
