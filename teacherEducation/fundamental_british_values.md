    * <details>
        * I may seem obvious to you, but from young people limited experience, they may not realise that other countries and cultures will have different values

            * It is possible that students family members are in conflict with these values
        </details>
* How do we explicitly call out these values as part of our wider education
* Q: How do we explicitly call these out in Computing lessons?
