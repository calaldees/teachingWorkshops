* DfE [Guidance on promoting British values in schools published](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/guidance-on-promoting-british-values-in-schools-published) 2014
* (I had not emphasised the importance of Fundamental British Values sufficiently in previous sessions)
* What are the FBVs'?
    * Rule of law
    * Individual liberty
    * Tolerance/Respect for others
    * Democracy
* Why do we need to explicitly describe these to young people as "Fundamental British Values"
    * <details>
        * I may seem obvious to you, but from young people limited experience, they may not realise that other countries and cultures do have different values
            * What do they do when they encounter these differences? 
        * Things they take for granted are not necessarily the way things are everywhere
        * It is possible that students family members are in conflict with these values
        </details>
* How do we explicitly call out these values as part of our wider education

TASK: Think Pair Share
* Q: How do we explicitly call these out in Computing lessons?

### Some ideas for computing

* Ethics
    * AI
        * How will bias affect "Tollerance/Respect" marginalised groups

    * Ongoing campaign for our digital rights

* Rule of Law
    * Computer misuse
    * Data protection rights - privacy
* Privacy - online safety - Trolls on the internet
* Careers
    * Being trans, gay or a minority does not affect your ability to code
