Curriculum
----------

### Teachers' Standards
7. Manage behaviour effectively to ensure a good and safe learning environment
    1. have clear rules and routines for behaviour in classrooms, and take responsibility for promoting good and courteous behaviour both in classrooms and around the school, in accordance with the school’s behaviour policy
    2. have high expectations of behaviour, and establish a framework for discipline with a range of strategies, using praise, sanctions and rewards consistently and fairly  
    3. manage classes effectively, using approaches which are appropriate to pupils’ needs in order to involve and motivate them 
    4. maintain good relationships with pupils, exercise appropriate authority, and act decisively when necessary.


### ITT Core Content Framework
* > 7.1. Establishing and reinforcing *routines*, including through positive reinforcement, can help create an effective learning environment.
    * routines
* > 7.2. A predictable and *secure environment* benefits all pupils, but is particularly valuable for pupils with special educational needs.
    * secure environment
* > 7.3. The ability to *self-regulate one’s emotions* affects pupils’ ability to learn, success in school and future lives.
    * self-regulate emotions
* > 7.4. Teachers can influence pupils’ resilience and beliefs about their ability to succeed, by ensuring all pupils have the opportunity to experience *meaningful success*.
    * meaningful success
* > 7.5. Building effective relationships is easier when pupils believe that their *feelings will be considered and understood*.
    * understood/consider child's feelings 
* > 7.6. Pupils are *motivated by intrinsic* factors (related to their identity and values) and extrinsic factors (related to reward).

* This weeks Mentor Led Foci
    * How is the department’s behaviour for learning policy implemented to aid learning? What effective strategies have been observed?

* In pairs
    * Can you describe how behaviour for learning policy is implemented in your school
        * (Do you have access to any 'behaviour for learning policy' documents? Can you access these now?)
    * Split a page into 4 (for your 2 schools) and identify similarities and differences

Task 2 (10min + 5min)
----

* How do teachers relate to pupils to support positive behaviour for learning?
* Think-Pair-Share
    * Can you describe an interaction between student and teacher that you observed that was

Intro
-----

* The first skill student teachers develop is behaviour management.
    * Without this fundamental, the house of cards cannot be built because learning cannot happen.

* My early teaching career
    * Recurring dream - students out of control - almost every night until the end of my NQT year - never dreamed again (maybe once every 6 months I can remember fragments?)


* Tip of the iceberg analogy - bits you don't see
* Managing classroom behaviour is 90% pro-active and 10% re-active
    * Remove the opportunity's for misbehaviour
    * Remove the incentives for misbehaviour
    * Promote meta-cognition and establish _behaviours for learning_

* [DfE Behaviour and discipline in schools](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/behaviour-and-discipline-in-schools) January 2016
    * Teachers have a power to impose detention outside school hours
    * Teachers can confiscate pupils’ property
    * Parental consent is not required for detentions

* The biggest influence over behaviour is the lesson content
    * Is the curriculum accessible to the learner?
    * Is this lesson worth behaving in?
* Is the environment safe? 
    * If child feels threatened they will not be able to analyse/judge properly
    * You could be perceived as the _threat_
        * (Think about this point for a second)

* Relationship needs: Tod and Elis 2017
    * Relationship with Self
    * Relationship with Others
    * Relationship with the Curriculum

### Benefits of good behaviour

* Stress lower (for everyone)
* Higher attainment
* Better use of time



### Task (15min)

* Divide page?/screen? into half (below)

| hypothetical misbehaviours | positive/expected behaviours |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Why does this behaviour occur? | Why does this behaviour occur? | 
| strategies for the above   | strategies for the above     |

* Consider highlighting behaviour that might be specific to a computer-room or online

<details>

Some of mine
* Late
* Missing Equipment
* Distracting Other Students
* Interrupting teacher
* Attention Seeking (taking time from teacher unnecessarily)
* Vandalism

* Self sabotage
* Cool
* Role? (the clown? - no other value - bad attention is better than no attention)
* More fun

(Spoiler: see incentives later)
</details>

### Examples of good behaviour

TASK: Compare with your pre-task list of _good behaviours_?

* Self (Engagement) [Emotional]
    * Confidence
    * Try new things
    * 99% of Computing is failure
* Subject (Access) [Cognitive]
    * wants to do it, knows how to do it, can do it
    * Interested
    * Motivated
    * Skills
* Teacher
    * Respectful
* Peers (Participation) [Social]
    * Communicate
    * Volunteer info
    * Wait to speak
    * Does not annoy others, keeps on task



Explicitly teach _Behaviour_
-----------------------------

* Explicit objectives, e.g. "build collaboration skills by"
    * Resourcefulness, Resilience, Perseverance
    * Ignoring distractions
    * Sharing equipment
    * Listen to others
    * Mindful of other time and emotional state (Empathy)

EEF
* > Teaching learning behaviours will reduce the need to manage misbehaviour
* > Teachers should encourage pupils to be self-reflective of their own behaviours
    * Meta cognition - thinking further than them

People talk about _The Hidden Curriculum_. 
What are you unconsciously teaching young people with your attitude and the culture you are creating?


Explicitly teach resilience
--------------------------

 #7-Behaviour-Learn-that-3-regulate_emotions
Programming is 98% Failing

Had 3rd year undergraduate - could not regulate - kept sighing and outwardly expressing frustration
metacognition - why am I feeling like this - what do I do if I get frustrated


Positive re-enforcement
-----------------------

You need both rewards and sanctions as tools.

Question: What is the difference between?
* Positive correction
* Positive reinforcement

### Culture

I sometimes joke that teachers have the role of a _Cult Leader_.
You are the leader of a cult.
Kind of an odd analogy, but an idea for a mindset. You create the rules, values, indoctrinate.

* Culture --> Shared Values of a group
* Unconsciously, we try to fit in, to conform. We often try to behave normally (for that culture)
* Normative messages
* Routines

### Performance and 'the bad day'

* If you are a west-end stage performer - you need to perform each night - regardless of your personal life
* Teaching is similar - the show must go on
* Your students already have enough struggles without yours

### As a teacher - are you intrusive?

* Public vs Private praise
    * Some children would be character assassinated if they had rapport with a teacher. Be mindful.
* Non verbal #7-Behaviour-Learn-how-6-non_verbal
    * (smile, thumbs up, nod)
    * pause, eye contact, shake head
    * gesture (4 legs on the floor)
* How Intrusive is your intervention?
    * #7-Behaviour-Learn-how-7-least_intrusive_intervention

### Praise

If you just focus on the negative/sanctions, that is only half of the story.

* Rewards should be consistent (just like sanctions should be consistent)
    * If the disruptive child sits still for 10min. That is not an opportunity for 'unstructured' praise, It is expected behaviour.
* Leaders should identify % of sanctions vs rewards. Teachers should be consistent across the school.
* Hollow praise should be avoided
    * Praise should be *specific* and given *with reasons*

TASK: From your observations - can you give an example of praise? was a reason/purpose given


Owning the physical space
-------------------------

The psychology of owning the physical space.

* The Entrance
* [Teacher Has Incredible Handshakes With Each Student](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VctaUNJpT6U)
* [Yeah this pretty much how I feel about laborious, performative welcome rituals](https://twitter.com/tombennett71/status/1375255533180100608) Tom Bennet, Gerry Dee
    * > This would have been my worse nightmare as a child - I would have dreaded going to school if a teacher had gone through this ritual. My class get a smile, eye contact and good morning and some still find that difficult to return
    * > From a wider behaviour management or safeguarding perspective I have always been nervous about staff who make the classroom experience to do with the ‘cult’ of their own personality or charisma. The ‘Miss Jean Brodie’ effect: an old film, but an important one.
    * > There is some research to suggest a positive greeting at the door can improve behaviour (Allday & Pakurar, 2007; Cook et al, 2018). There is no evidence that this greeting needs to be time-consuming and the most effective individualisation is using the pupil’s name.


* Line up
    * No one enters your space
* Happy greet chat banter as they line up
* Tidy uniform - respect for themselves and the space they are about to enter
    * "Ave some self respect"
* Positive comments?
    * "Looking sharp!"
    * "Loving the smile!"
    * "Oh crumbs - I hope it wont be that bad!?"
    * (just a nod or thumbs up)
* Calmed (not shouting)
    * Some of them barrel down the corridors and are flustered when they arrive
* Enter calmly and orderly
    * Send some out/back if needed
* Routine to start starter task #7-Behaviour-Learn-that-1-routines
    * Start On board? 
    * Starter on paper?
    * Log-on + Load up IDE? routine?
* Do not be afraid to repeat whole class procedures if the class don't settle
    * If the class get too unfocused and you can't get their focus back - take the whole class outside to line up again

In the event that the class are already in the classroom (+settled) when you arrive. Assert dominance over the space
* If the lights are off turn them on (or off)
* Open the windows
* Move a desk/chair


### Tips

* Keyboards up, Screens off
    * Humans are like moths to a light-bulb - they CANNOT not use computers
    * Get RAZOR good at detecting a single mouse/keyboard click and stop immediately
        * (as you get more experienced you have more cognitive capacity to do this)
* Routine for transitions
    * Timer on board? Countdown(like tv show)? Bell? Keyboards up? Screens off?

### Room layout

* Room layout: See as many screens as possible
    * 2 walkways == 75% visual coverage (50% alternating)
    * U shape == 100% coverage (not space efficient)
    * Rows == (oh no!), clear screen off routines
* Teacher "Desktop remote class control system" (I'm not sure of it's value)
    * This takes agency and responsibility away from the student

BATTLEPLAN!
TASK: Pair up - Draw a layout of your teaching space on A2/A1 paper? - Discuss
Label:
* best viewpoints for teachers (see majority of screens and door)
* Worst viewpoints for teachers
* Best case travel times
* Worst case travel times
* Students instinctively know the "Best" places to get away with bad behaviour. Where are they?

* Doorway visibility trick
    * have sanctioned student out of sight of class
    * Still have classroom coverage (you may be discussing for some time)



Sanctions (Negative enforcement)
--------------------------------

* [Makes me think of code reviews and gym class](https://twitter.com/aprilwensel/status/1449871041157754881/photo/1)
    * > You cannot humiliate people into excellence

### Good sanctions are
* clear (unambiguous)
* concrete (give examples)
* sequential (do x, then y, n then z)
* consistent/fair
* timely

Practical application
* Language of choice/ownership
    * By continuing to X you are _choosing to_ Y
* Allow take-up time
* Ignore secondary behaviours (but follow them up!)
    * e.g. huffing and sighing, slamming a door, rolling of eyes, repeating/delaying with questions

### Identifying Behaviour Incentives

* Always look for the _incentive_ for behaviour
    * What is the incentive to behave, what is the incentive not to behave?
    * Are other adults or young people providing this culture/reward
* They adhere to their social _role_/_status_

> The benefits (like looking good among peers) outweigh the costs (looking bad to teachers/parents).
> It’s worth recalling Graham Nuthall’s conclusion: 
> "When there is a clash between the peer culture and the teacher’s management procedures, the peer culture wins every time (2007, p.37)."

* Some behaviour is calculated
    * > (1) the benefit that one stands to gain from the crime; 
      > (2) the probability of getting caught; and 
      > (3) the expected punishment if one is caught. 
      > By comparing the first component (the gain) with the last two components (the costs), the rational human being can determine whether a particular crime is worth it or not.
        * (Ariely, 2013, p.14)
* Some behaviour is habitual
    * No calculated choice. Just adolescent self centred autopilot
    * It's not deliberate _evil_ it's just lack of social skills and socialisation
    * You can impact this!

TASK: of the behaviours you identified in your pre-reading. Which ones could be _calculated_ and which ones could be _habitual_?
Do any stand out?

### Detention

Should be productive and have a purpose.

* [When do detentions work?](https://improvingteaching.co.uk/2020/03/01/when-do-detentions-work/) Harry Fetcher-wood - March 2020
    * Prioritise immediacy over intensity
    * Ensure sanctions stick (they happen)
    * Make detentions productive
    * Say _why_ and _what next_

* [Ms McInerney’s “Book of Consequences” Detention System](https://lauramcinerney.com/ms-mcinerneys-book-of-consequences-detention-system/)
    * > They WILL happen - mean what you say
    * WRITE IT!
    * > the initial question on the sheet asked pupils to write why they were in detention. 
      > I reckon about 60% of kids said something different to the reason why I had put them on detention. 
      > Sometimes they even admitted things I hadn’t seen
    * > students lied a lot less about what had happened because their words were being put down on paper. 
    * > I always make pupils sign their papers and agree to what their future solution will be. Being able to get out those papers if there is ever another detention is VERY helpful for parent’s evening

Concept?
* Once they understand the reason and have a resolution - they are there ...
* Make them fun - build rapport - show them something amazing about computing
    * The punishment is that you're directing their time.

TASK: Question: Should a detention ever be fun? Why? Why Not?

#### Students feel

* Teachers are evil (they all self centred. none of them understand or care about me)
* I'm not academic (even if I try it's pointless)
* This is a waste of my time (it's not relevant to me)
* School is shit (there is nothing good here other than my friends)
* There are places where you are told where to go and you can only piss at certain times, they are called prisons

### Resolutions - Discussions with students
Doughnut conversation
(I've lost count of how many times I've had this conversation ... )

* Regulate
* Relate
* Reason
    * self, peers, curriculum(task)
https://www.beaconhouse.org.uk
(smalling doors is not acceptable)
* reintegrate plan?
    * now
    * next time


* "Why are being such a tit" will not work
* They cant answer - they dont knkow
* cant self regulate


* Resolution: Explain Why (meta behaviour)
    * The number 1 factor for success/happiness == socialisation. This is more important than ANY subject knowledge/skill
* Separate 'The Person' from 'The Behaviour'
    * I want you in my classroom, but that behaviour should stay outside

* Tone of conversation 
    * It's not an attack. It's a adult to adult conversation
    * (subtext: you are reassuring them they are safe)
* Why am I (the teacher) here? ... I'm here help you ... I'm not your enemy
* You're trying to get through your own stuff. I have a job to teach the others.
* What are we going to do so that we can both have a better experience moving forward? 
    * Agree together.
    * Young people can't really have this as a two way discussion as they lack the skillset analysis and experience. You can fill that in. make suggestions. Agree together.

    * Role model (calm)
    * Stories with lots of questions (play)

### Support (SEN + Behavioural specialists)

Sometimes you just work with young people that are 
* deeply disturbed
* aggressive
* disruptive
* lack empathy
* lack respect
* come from troubled homes
* Don't appear to learn change or grow

How to deal with these
* This is not your fault
* You can't change everyone you meet
* You should perform your role as normal
* Use the school scansion system
* There will be specialist SEN and Behavioural specialists in your school
* Seek support/advice when needed

Story: My Year 11 Friday P5 group. What my line manager said.


Strategies
-----------

### Weak strategies by teachers

* Bribes (sweets, or leave early)
    * They take away from the focus being learning
* Anger, rage, loss of control (by you)
    * Will result in lack of respect
    * Note: This is not the same as stern discontent or frustration

### Emotional conveyance as a tool

Elaboration on teacher use of emotion and anger/discontent
* Sometimes children cannot identify with the severity of a situation with just words
* Sometimes a wide _pallet of emotion_ must be used
* I've tried to explain to groups of children. Sometimes they just don't understand. My words alone lack impact
* I have to perform the pantomime of emotion to convey the message to the target audience
* I'm not angry at them. I don't hate them. They are normal children. But I have to pretend to escalate my emotional state to communicate the intention effectively.


### Computing Specific disruptions

TASK (5min?): Create a list of computing room specific misbehaviours


* Bolt the computers down
* Broken computers are _clearly_ marked.
    * If not marked students will try to _fix_ them, and cause more problems!
        * Broken ports!
        * Unplugging mice from other machines to sit next-to their friends
    * Plan for broken computers in your seating plan
* Constant distraction to all students at all time
    * Keyboards up (visual scan)
    * Turn screens off?
* Hacking; key loggers
* Lost files, didn't save, cant find it
* Non verbal student communication (e.g. typing and looking at each other screens)
* Water (kryptonite to computers)
* Off task (so many distracting things)
* TVBeGone
* Computer Misuse (interrupting another program)
* Use of facility's for other subjects (Your room could become disrupted/damaged/used)
* _Insert_ Mode (insert key - tears)
* [Accessibility Shortcuts](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-keyboard-shortcuts-for-accessibility-021bcb62-45c8-e4ef-1e4f-41b8c1fc87fd) and [StickyKeys](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-turn-off-sticky-keys-windows-10) - Know how to identify them
    * This can disrupt lesson by a confused student
        * Beeps on every keypress
        * Invert screen colours
        * Change language
        * Rotate screen


Computer Misuse
---------------

Quote the act when discussing behaviour.

[Computer Misuse Act 1990](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/contents)
* Interfere with the running of somebody else's program
* Access 
    * 1 Year
* Access with further intent 
    * 5 years + unlimited fine
* Access + Change 
    * 10 Years + unlimited fine

* Washing machine - turn off
* Turn another students machine off
* Look at their messages


Stories
-------

My stories from teaching

* The Angry kid (stomping in)
* The class that would not settle (fire extinguish)
* The plum to the back of the head - and the outcome
* Ice cream at the side of the bus
* Gifts (hiding game)
* The Weird Kid
* The Hacker Kid - technicians
* Year 11 P5 Friday - Remove the class

Task: Spotlight: Putting it all together
----

TASK:
Using content/ideas from this session.
In Groups of 3:
* List one of your misbehaviours
* Invite other members of the group to suggest courses of action
* Discuss
    * The underlying origin of what that behaviour might occur
    * Reactive Strategies? Pro-active strategies?
    * Short term action, Long term action
    * Involving Others?
        * Head of department? Form tutor? Parent? Head of year/House? Other Subject teachers? Other students? SENco?
    * Culture? Calculated/Habitual actions? Secondary behaviours?
    * Real young people have a complex background/experiences. They will not behave in 1 dimensional ways


More Reading

* [A systematic review of how theories explain learning behaviour in school contexts](http://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Portals/0/PDF%20reviews%20and%20summaries/BM(CCC)_2004review.pdf?ver=2006-03-02-125203-580) Powell, Tod 2004
    * A curriculum that focuses on 'performance'19 learning is less motivating than a pedagogy and curriculum that seeks to secure 'mastery'20 learning. 
    * Motivation is improved if positive outcomes are made meaningful, feasible and accessible to pupils.
    * Competitive classroom contexts, that have a performance-approach to teaching and learning, are linked to disruptive behaviours.
    * introducing more on-task verbal interaction between pupils; pupils benefit from being grouped with 'knowledgeable others' to enhance their learning experience and augment cognitive development.
    * Problems around self-efficacy and behaviour have little to do with subject- specific factors and more to do with how the learner identifies with the immediate factors and immediate judgements/anxieties in the classroom context.
    * Findings from the review support the view that researchers perceive that there may be generic components of learning behaviours, although some components may be subject-specific. These subject-specific components may explain pupils' differing attainment and behaviours in different lessons. It is reasonable to conclude that the promotion of effective learning behaviour can be considered to be intrinsic to effective teaching and learning, and should be addressed by teachers/tutors and mentors through their subject teaching.

Ofsted: Review of sexual abuse

* [Ofsted: Review of sexual abuse in schools and colleges](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-sexual-abuse-in-schools-and-colleges/review-of-sexual-abuse-in-schools-and-colleges)
    * > It is concerning that for some children, incidents are so commonplace that they see no point in reporting them.
      > It recommends that schools, colleges and multi-agency partners act as though sexual harassment and online sexual abuse are happening, even when there are no specific reports.
    * > girls told us that sexual harassment and online sexual abuse, such as being sent unsolicited explicit sexual material and being pressured to send nude pictures (‘nudes’), are much more prevalent than adults realise. For example, nearly 90% of girls, and nearly 50% of boys, said being sent explicit pictures or videos of things they did not want to see happens a lot or sometimes to them or their peers.
      > Children and young people told us that sexual harassment occurs so frequently that it has become ‘commonplace’. For example, 92% of girls, and 74% of boys, said sexist name-calling happens a lot or sometimes to them or their peers. The frequency of these harmful sexual behaviours means that some children and young people consider them normal.
      * > When we asked children and young people where sexual violence occurred, they typically talked about unsupervised spaces outside of school, such as parties or parks without adults present, although some girls told us they also experienced unwanted touching in school corridors.
      * > Children and young people, especially girls, told us that they do not want to talk about sexual abuse for several reasons, even where their school encourages them to. For example, the risk of being ostracised by peers or getting peers into trouble is not considered to be worth it for something perceived by children and young people to be commonplace. They worry about how adults will react, because they think they will not be believed, or that they will be blamed. They also think that once they talk to an adult, the process will be out of their control.
      * > Children and young people were rarely positive about the RSHE they had received. They felt that it was too little, too late and that the curriculum was not equipping them with the information and advice they needed to navigate the reality of their lives. Because of these gaps, they told us they turned to social media or their peers to educate each other, which understandably made some feel resentful. As one girl put it, ‘It shouldn’t be our responsibility to educate boys’.
      * > In the schools and colleges we visited, some teachers and leaders underestimated the scale of the problem. They either did not identify sexual harassment and sexualised language as problematic or they were unaware they were happening.

    1. Start prevention early
        * Prevention efforts should begin with prenatal care and continue throughout the school years
    2. Positive consequences matter
        * Provide positive consequences to increase desirable behaviours
    3. Effective negative consequences matter
        * Clear, immediate, mild negative consequences can reduce problem behaviours
    4. Build skills through practice
        * Create opportunities for children to observe and practice interpersonal as well as academic skills.
    5. Monitor a child’s behaviour
        * Know where children and adolescents are, what they are doing and with whom, and provide appropriate supervision.
    6. Limit opportunities for misbehaviour
        * Reduce youths’ access to the situations in which problem behaviour is particularly likely to occur
    7. Reduce environmental stressors
        * Reduce children’s exposure to negative conditions that cause stress
    8. Limit biological risks
        * Encourage good biological functioning throughout development
    9. Discourage aggression
        * Reducing aggressive behaviour among young children can prevent many problems later on
    10. Create appropriate norms
        * Establishing strong, clear norms for behaviour can influence youths’ behaviour

### Perceptions from an experienced teacher

I've seen the behaviour patters before. 
The same patterns repeating over and over and over.
I have all the tools. But they take time/effort/mental-energy to use.

You see a student chimping about and you just get board. 
You will have to go through hours of re-enforcement, hours of the same conversations that you've had year after year.
Sometimes it will have an impact sometimes it wont. 
After a year of hard graft, all the progress is lost (the summer reset) as you get another army of untrained chimps.
