Setting the scene
-----------------

I have heard the phrase:
> Teachers are pillars of our society

You are *role models for our society's future*
... that's a fairly significant responsibility


Learning Objectives
-------------------

* Consider how your personal perception of yourself and your role in society may need to change
* Understand the concept/role of "Organisation/Business Process"
* Reminder of the distinction of "Formal Communication"

Times
-----

* Your changing role in society (15min)
* Business Process (15min)
* Formal communication (10min)
* My stories highlighting the above (20min)

Look out for the 10 revelation, mind blown bombshells!
If you think it's a valid point - hit the 'like/reaction' (demo)


Personal and Professional Identity
----------------------------------

* Bombshell 1
    * Transitioning from "being provided for" to "providing".
    * YOUR ROLE IS SOCIETY IS ABOUT TO CHANGE!
    * Have you thought about the impact of this ... 
    * This is one of the biggest transitions in your life!

* Bombshell 2
    * Get out of the mindset of being "a student at uni". You are NOT a _student_, you are a professional in training.
        * Some young student teachers struggle with being close in age but having a full professional role

My commentary
> I wanted to do a meaningful job. 
> When I started teaching; I had passion and energy, but it was wild passion and energy, I did not really have the skills or focus to back up what I wanted to do. 
> I wanted to stand on desks and use humour in my lessons.
> I felt conflict between my ideals as a teacher and the other staff. 
> Could I do this profession? 
> Could I still be me *and* do this job?

Where do you feel you stand on this?

POLL: With the burden of being a _professional_ do you think you will:
1. Have to hide/conceal your true self
2. Fear that you will have to change into a different person
3. Exited that you will change into a different person
4. Don't know

My conclusion
> Spoiler alert:
> There was no _conflict_ with other staff
> Of course I could still be me and teach

* Bombshell 3
    * Be 100% yourself, don't change who you are, but watch your terminology/language/conduct
    * You can be a professional *and* still be a badass

At the moment you have a strong _personal identity_. In time you will develop a _professional identity_

> A strong sense of teacher _professional identity_ is linked to the retention of teachers within the profession

Anecdotal Story: Asked a friend asked at a family christmas meal "I'm 18, but I don't feel like an an adult. When will I know I'm an adult?"



Basics
------

(repeat of earlier sessions, but I can't stress this enough!)

* Be punctual and reliable
    * "Sorry I'm late" is not acceptable now that you have a duty of care over 30 young people
* Dressed appropriately
    * Hair well kept
* Be proactive
    * Don't expect somebody else to fix your problems automatically
    * Be a _net positive_ to your organisation
* Keep your phone off!!! (SERIOUSLY!!!)
    * Focus on your role (There is little _downtime_ in schools)
* Do not discuss politics or religion at your place of work
    * This will likely alienate people. It is not relevant to your role.
* Be mindful of gossip and boundaries


Friends?
--------

* Bombshell 4
    * Your colleagues do not need to be your friends
        * You can respect them as professionals effectively and interact with them but still not _like_ them
        * How much _you like them_ is not an indicator of their professional worth
        * Don't expect them to be _your mates_
    * Your students do not need to be your friends
        * They don't have to like you. They HAVE to respect you.
            * "Why do you want a bunch of 13 year-old friends?"
        * Your role is to support ALL students in making progress (however nice or horrible they are. Take your bias out)


Courageous Leadership
---------------------

TASK: Word Vomit Whiteboard
* What words would you use to describe 
    * the professionals that you have admired
    * the kind of professionals that you want to become

### Let's choose ...

* You have a duty of care over your students.
* I would like to extend that to.
* Bombshell 5
    * You have a duty of care over your team (this includes your colleges).
    * Your have some element of control over your teams emotional state.

> Let's all choose to be the leaders we wish we had
<sub>Simon Sinek</sub>

### My notes

* Be calm and purposeful
    * Who would you trust
        * Heart surgeon flapping arms around and shouting 'oh no there is blood everywhere'
        * Heart surgeon calming explaining the breach and asking for the next tool
* Be mindful of cyclic negativity. Don't _whinge_
    * Identify problems - collate/suggest solutions - take action points
* Identify the *spirit* of conversations/actions
    * Are you colleagues being offensive? or are they expressing frustration?


Business Process
----------------

### Why do we need Process/Rules/Systems?

TASK: Why do we have rules. Why do they exist?
Answers in the chat - (If we have a small enough group breakout groups?)

---

* The presence of a rule (hopefully) creates a better outcome (than no rule)
* As an individual you may not be aware of all possible situations and their knock-on effects.
    * You can't do this deep thinking in the spur of the moment
    * You can't have the understanding or perspective of all/more stakeholders rather than just your perspective
* Consistency
    * Across a large geographic area


TASK: Why do organisations have _process's_
Answers in the chat - (If we have a small enough group breakout groups?)
* e.g. 
    * Why do we have chain's of command?
    * Why do we have lists of steps to perform for some of our tasks?
    * Why do we have an absence process?
    * What incidents should you report? and to who?
        * Accidents? behaviour?
    * Why do we train people to sit at a computer?
    * Why is their a process for handling peoples names, address genders?



* (All of the rational for rules)
* Organisations are accountable for their actions
    * (Imagine a world where an organisation was continuously using bad practice and each time this is unveiled an individual is just fired and the organisation continue making the same mistake)

* Bombshell 6
    * Organisations could metaphorically be described as living breathing things
* Bombshell 7
    * Rules and Process make things better

There are established
* Process's
    * When/how you can search a child? or confiscate their items?
    * What behaviour should you report, and to who?
* Channels of communication
    * How do you report your absence?
    * One does not simply - send an email to headteacher?
* Codes of conduct
    * What standards are you required to hold?

### Example of a high level process

[Bianca Williams: Sprinter says 'I've never had to experience anything like this'](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/53305712)
> Officers from the Directorate of Professional Standards have reviewed both footage from social media, and the body-worn video of the officers, and are satisfied that there is no concern around the officers' conduct.
(But that did'nt stick
[Bianca Williams stop-and-search: Met PCs face probe](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-54466254))

* Bombshell 8
* When you tackle _issues_, you should consider if issue is with the _process_ or the issue is with the _individual_.
    * When we fail, we fail as a team - When we fail, we fail as an organisation.
    * In the majority of cases altering the process is the best course of action.


### Business Comms/Handbooks/Training

* You will have induction packs/training.
* As a member of staff you are expected to know all of it.
* Ignorance is not an excuse.

* Many organisations have online e-learning.
* You have to tick a box to say I've read this.

* Is it the _organisations_ fault or _your_ fault?

* If you've ticked the box - then you should know - It's your fault.

(This is an important semantic requirement. Some trainee teachers have been barred from school sites until they had completed this _online training_ + clicked 'I understand')

### Summary of national process's for schools

* Handbook for Educational Professionals: The Bristol Guide 2020/21
    * [Printed](https://bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/handbook-for-education-bristol-guide-2021-2022) £6.50
    * [Amazon Kindle](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Handbook-Education-Bristol-Guide-2021-2022-ebook/dp/B09BNMR129/) £5

* When/how is appropriate to search a student?
* Is the school responsible for bullying outside the school premises?

### Problems with business process?

If you feel the business process has treated you unfairly and you need further advice. This is what a union is for. Join one!

* [Teacher Unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teachers%27_trade_unions_in_the_United_Kingdom)

ACTION POINT: After this talk read up on what the unions stand for.
* Research your unions principles.
* Some unions believe that _striking_ is too aggressive and considers _chalk-downs_.



Written Communication - Use _Plain English_
-------------------------------------------

*Everyone* should read this.
It will take time to master.

* [How to write in plain English](http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/how-to-write-in-plain-english.html)
    * Keep your sentences short
    * Use 'you' and 'we'
    * Use words that are appropriate for the reader
    * Don't be afraid to give instructions
    * Avoid nominalisations
    * Use lists where appropriate
    * Prefer active verbs
        * This matter will be considered by us shortly. (Passive)
        * We will consider this matter shortly. (Active)
        * The riot was stopped by the police. (Passive)
        * The police stopped the riot. (Active)
        * The mine had to be closed by the authority. (Passive)
        * The authority had to close the mine. (Active)
    * [hemingwayapp.com](https://hemingwayapp.com/)
        * Online _plain english_ hints

TASK: Take 120 seconds to look at `hemingwayapp.com`. Hover over the colours.

* Bombshell 9
    * You probably need to upskill in your ability to write _Plain English_


Formal Communication
--------------------

### Email

Email is a _formal_ means of communication.
* It is recorded.
* It is evidence.
* It is tracked.
* Don't use emoji's or slang in emails. It is not a chat system.


Why is email so important?
* Verbally - things get lost/forgotten/don't-exist
* Email - It becomes real/tangible/trackable

Tips:
* Learn how to use _cc_ and _bcc_ effectively
* Use 'reply' and 'replyall' effectively
* You need to be able to cope with significant volumes of email from multiple sources with limited time
    * Setup email filter rules to automatically sort incoming email into folders
* Bombshell 10
* Consider every single email _public domain_
    * Anyone can make a GDPR subject access request and demand all the data an organisation holds on them (including every email ever sent)
    * Do not make snide/condescending comments or jokes about children/staff/parents/ANYONE with your work email address. Keep EVERY message professional.
        * (Convey sensitive information or voice your internal emotional state to other staff verbally)

Unsorted Notes
==============



Interacting with your mentor
----------------------------

* [What informs mentors' practice when working with trainees and newly qualified teachers? An investigation into mentors' professional knowledge base](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02607470600655227) 2007 Jones M, Straker K
    * > (mentors) described as challenging working with ‘weak’ or ‘unwilling’ trainees, dealing with trainees' personal stress and mediating between trainee and colleagues
* Mentors are not your agony aunt or therapist. You have a professional role to perform.
* Respect professional boundaries with all staff


Judging other professionals
--------------------------
* As a novice - Bite your tongue
* You simply DO NOT have the knowledge/experience to make any judgement at all
* Ask questions to investigate your concerns, but DO NOT PASS JUDGEMENT
* _Listen_ more than talk


Verbal Language
---------------

(Skip to email as this was covered in earlier session)

> I'm disinclined to acquiesce your request.
> It means "No"
<sub>Pirates of the Caribbean</sub>


TASK: What alternate language could we use to relay these feelings in a professional context?
* It's shit
* Doing this takes too long
* X is an idiot!
* I can't do this
* he doesn't like me
* I did it because YOLO



Possible suggestions
* It's shit -> This is not optimal/ideal
* Doing this takes too long -> I feel the time I am spending on X is disproportionate
* X is an idiot! -> X might have misunderstood the objectives of Y
* I can't do this -> I'm struggling with X
* he doesn't like me -> there is a failure of trust in this relationship
* I did it because YOLO -> I took this action because the short term risk was low

Summary
* If you talk like a child you will be treated like child
* If you talk like a professional you will be treated like professional
* Listen to the language the professionals around you use

Professionals in their domain can convey a lot of meaning with very few words.

e.g. In my domain of software engineering the senior developers used phrases like
* This improves the Developer experience
* Watch out, this is an _Anti-pattern_
* We need to segment then _Problem space_
* Remove the intermediary (...variable)
