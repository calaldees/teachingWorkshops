Hi Computing Mentors,

I've recently got involved with a national group of Computing Mentors/Educators and attended their first remote meeting earlier in the year.
This could be a great resource to network with other Computing mentors across the country.
The next meeting will be on "Wednesday 19th April 16:00 - 17:30pm via Google meet" (see below for agenda and join link).

The group is organised by Rachel Arthur. rarthur@teachfirst.org.uk https://twitter.com/MsArthurCompSci
You can contact her to be added to her mailing list if you are interested.

This looks like a very topical and relevant new emerging group. The meetings are every 3 months-ish. I'm interested in how this group is going to grow.

I will be in touch with you all soon to organise a second mentor visit.
Keep in touch.
