JudgeMentoring
==============


* YouTube [The Terrors of JudgeMentoring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFCuv5uS48Q) 51min Professor Andrew Hobson - University of Brighton 2016
   * Trainee teachers are "vulnerable learners" (Shanks)
   * Mentoring is often of more benefits to the mentors
   * Mentoring is has disadvantages
      * Stunting beginners teachers professional development
      * Reproducing conventional norms and practices
      * Bring anxiety and stress
      * Contributing to early career teachers leaving the profession
   * Why issues
      * Insufficient time
      * Poor mentor selection process (not just handed out)
      * Inadequate mentor preparation
         * (without training - default is 'telling' students what to do)
      * Mentor role does not have sufficiently high status
      * Insufficient funding
      * Conflicting roles of "support" and "formal assessment" - obstacle to an open trusting relationship
   * > a one to one relationship between a relatively inexperienced teacher (the mentree) and a relatively experienced one (the mentor) in which the latter, in revealing too readily and/or too often her/his own judgements on or evaluations of the mentee's planning and teaching... compromises the mentoring relationship and it's potential benefits (Hobson & Malderez 2013, P 90)
      * Too Evaluative, judgmental, directive
      * > If it's judgemental then it's not mentoring
   * > [From Mentor] When I talk to a trainee after observing them teach the things I focus upon, first of all .. is the good sound education points .. I make them feel that there are some good things coming out here. If there are points, which inevitably there will be, which need to be addressed, they must be addressed constructively .. and I present the trainee with a se of strategies for dealing with them
   * Nature of the mentoring can lead to
      * fabrication of strategic silence
         * Avoid discussing failings
      * distract attention - e.g. draw mentors attention to lessons with good behaviour rather than seeking their support for difficult class's
      * Should be declared and seek help
   3. Encourages Over reliance on Mentors
      * learned helplessness
   5. impedes wellbeing
   6. Contributes to "reality aftershock"
      * Sudden reduction in support in ECT year
   * Causes of JudgeMentoring
      1. Conflicting 'supporting' and 'assessment' roles
         * Mentors and Line Manager the same role (this is often problematic) - refereed to as On-Line mentoring
      2. Use of mentoring as remedial strategy to address perceived under-performance
         * A stigma to being mentored
      3.  National Policy
         * Continues to imbue this 'support + assessment' roles
         * Establishing Mentor standards ... ongoing discussion
* (Currently) Lack of a specific research informed mentoring
    * ONSIDE Mentoring
        * Reflective practitioner approach
        * Growth and compassion based approaches
        * Scaffolding
        * Self determination theory
            * Competence, autonomy are supported
    * Imperatives
        1. On the side of mentees (vulnerable learners)
            * Supporters, champions, advocates
        2. Off-line(management) mentoring
        3. Non-Judgemental and non-evaluative
            * (This needs practice and skill!)
        4. Supportive of mentees psycho social needs
        5. Individualised
        6. Developmental (growth oriented)
            * support mentees to find their own
            * Progressively "non directive" and "autonomy promoting"
