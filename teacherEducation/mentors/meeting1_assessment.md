### Purpose
* Share and develop the subject (and curriculum) expertise of all Teacher Educators

* Verify upcoming Student Progress Review (SPR) process
* Explore the first three Key Spotlight Questions:
    * Who are we?
    * How do you learn to teach?
    * What is a teacher?
* (Just checking - aware of key spotlight questions?)

### Timings? (1 hour?)

1. Intro (10min)
1. Student Progress Reviews (20min)
2. Visits (5min)
3. Build a network (breakout rooms) (15min)
4. What is a Teacher Educator? What is a Computing Teacher? (10min)
5. Closing and Next Steps (5min)
6. (Optional: Informal chat + addition) (30min)

(Can we fit it all in?)

Visits
------

* Required to have one visit per placement
    * Face-to-face or virtual
* Mentor facing/focused
    * My role is to Support/QA your mentoring
    * (I can watch the student teach if needed)
* Could align with SPR1?


Build a network (15min)
---------------

* It would be valuable to build contacts with other mentors
* Discuss your mentoring
    * strategies
    * targets
    * difficulties


What is a Teacher Educator?
---------------------------
DISCLAIMER - I don't have an answers to this

* How can we as mentors and tutors develop our expertise?
    * Mentoring -> Coaching?
    * Theory/Scholarship?

* Research
    * [What informs mentors' practice when working with trainees and newly qualified teachers? An investigation into mentors' professional knowledge base](https://github.com/calaldees/teachingWorkshops/blob/master/teacherTraining/__CCF-reading-summary.md#mentor-knowledge) 2007 Jones M, Straker K
        * > ‘referring to theory’ appears to range low on most mentors' agenda
        * > we need to enable mentors to free themselves from the idiosyncratic practices they may have developed over the years by providing access to adequate training and developmental programmes


What is a Computing Teacher?
----------------------------
DISCLAIMER - I don't have an answers to this

* What does it mean to be a teacher of Subject? 
* Do we all have a common understanding?

### Research

* [Teaching algorithms in upper secondary education: a study of teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08993408.2021.1935554) 2020 - Jacqueline Nijenhuis-Voogt, Durdane Bayram-Jacobs, Paulien C. Meijer, Erik Barendsen
    * Conflicting approaches
        * "Thinking" (just the concept) or "Thinking and Making" (doing it in code)
        * > Transcribing to real code is not carried out by my students. [After writing the algorithm in pseudo-code], it does not add any value ...
        * > I want my students to be able to specify a logical solution for a problem on the level of elementary building blocks so you can make a one-on-one translation to a programming language
        * > Students will make something so they really get an idea what it involves rather than remaining theoretical
* [Active Learning by Visual Programming: Pedagogical Perspectives of Instructivist and Constructivist Code Teachers and Their Implications on Actual Teaching Strategies and Students’ Programming Artifacts](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/07356331211017793) 2021 - Avital Kesler, Tamar Shamir-Inbal, Ina Blau
    *  > the beginning of the process, artifacts of students guided by instructivist teachers were found to be higher in their programming level quality, compared to the products of students guided by constructivist teachers.
    *  > students who learn by constructivist guidance and over time gain experience in visual programming, close the gap with students learning under instructivist guidance in their ability to create an artifact at a good programming level. It can be assumed that ongoing constructivist guidance emphasizing active learning, encourages students to choose high standards for their projects
    *  > (constructivist) ... will ultimately lead students to overall and broader success in the learning process, although this does require additional time.
    *  > After six months of experience under constructivist guidance, students were able to program with a base of wider personal knowledge and experience


Closing and Next Steps
----------------------

* Interaction as a partnership 
    * 3rd year computer science undergrads wanting and understanding of school teaching before embarking on PGCE application?
    * Assistance with Interviewing PGCE candidates
* The next Session 
    * Thursday 13th January 2022 - 16.30 – 17:30
