concious competence == saying "mirror signal manurer"
unconcious incompitence == you just drive? really need to think about the steps

They may want to bury the failure - you must help them unpick it


co-observe a lesson - prompt the student with what to look for
oberve a sequence of lesson
observe (with a focus)


Meeting record done by the student - you sign it off each week
The weekly meeting is the most important moment of the week
Left hand side
 Review targets from previous week
 3 Targests for this week (there will be more, but whats most urgent)
    specific, mesurable, A, R, T
 eventually these targets will be pupil progress targets
 (support they need - not nessisrally mentor, point in right direction)
Right hand side is reflections
 how week, well, not well, why
 rolfs model - what _so what_ now what
 kolb reflection, theorising, expeimenting, experience (advanced)

If they have the same target every week this may be alarm bells

One formal observation each week
 * lesson plan (provided by student) on CCCU proforma (in advance? 24h?)
    * give them a focus for you observations (linked to targets from weekly meeting?)
 * your observations form - ask them 'how do you think it went?' - limit what you share, 2 or 3 prioritys
    * who was most engaged? who was not engaged?
 * evaluatiion (by student)
Move beyond _just descriptions_ - move towards analysis/evaluation _why_s

practical working documents - not perfect masterpeices

When they hit a low patch - go back through the older weekley meetings to show progress

observe other subjects

You are a pivotal character in their career

Feel free to contact me to discuss anything if needed.
I'm looking forward to working with you.


### 2021

Hi YYYY,
(XXXX: Thanks for the introduction)
(CC'ing in ZZZZ as Professional Mentor as part of process)

I am XXXX's Subject Tutor at Canterbury Christ Church University (CCCU).
Thank you so much for being part of our partnership and taking on-board a trainee teacher.

I wanted to extend an offer of support to assist you with your mentoring.
Ofted have identified that across the country there is often a disconnect between the mentoring in school and guidance from university's. 
As part of my role at at CCCU I am to support mentors with the mentoring process by providing guidance and collaboration to support our trainees.

It would be good to meet you over the next couple of months to discuss in more detail our training curriculum and collaborate on ideas to support XXXX.
I can visit your school in person or we can arrange a 'virtual visit' via MSTeams.
This visit/support is optional, but generally encouraged.

If you want to book a 'quick chat' video meeting with me or book a longer 'remote mentor visit' you can use my online booking link (also in my footer).
https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/PGCESDComputing@cccu.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/

We have a range of mentor resources to support you at:
http://ccccumentors.org.uk
username: cccu-mentors
password: CCCUmentors

Have you mentored before or are you a veteran mentor?
Are you aware of the subject curriculum XXXX is following at uni?

I'm looking forward to working with you this year.
Let's keep in touch.


Mentor Visit Email Templates
---------------------------

### Initial Visit (first attempt)

Subject: Placement visit for School Direct Computing

Dear Colleagues,

Thank you for hosting our Computing student on their training placement on the School Direct programme.
I hope that despite all the complexities presented by the start to this academic year, things have settled down for you and you feel you have established a positive working relationship with your student.

My purpose in writing now is to inform you that I wish to set up my first (virtual) placement visit at a mutually convenient time in the next few weeks.
Just to give you the background to this, each student is allocated two visits over the course of the year, as well as a slot in the summer for the final assessment.
As you can imagine in the current circumstances, these visits will take place online until further notice and I would like to suggest that we use Microsoft Teams for this purpose. 
(Microsoft Teams can be accessed through any web browser as a guest).
As I have a number of upcoming PGCE visits, it would be most convenient if I could complete this first set of visits by mid November.

I want to emphasise that the role is my visit is purely to be supportive of you in your role as mentor to ensure that the student has the best possible training experience this year.
As you may be aware from communications with the University, the focus of the placement visit is now very much on using this time to work directly with the Subject Mentor, rather than working with the student directly.

-- Visit breakdown --

The visit itself should last around two hours.

I would like to spend the first 30 minutes of this time meeting with you as the Subject Mentor to explore the approaches that you have taken in mentoring your student thus far. 
To facilitate this discussion, I would like to draw your attention to the extract of the "Partnership Evaluation Framework" document attached.
This lists the areas that are key to successful mentoring and will act as a focus for our discussions.

What we do in the second hour will depend upon the model of visit that you chose. 
For this I draw your attention to "Subject Mentor - Tutor visits and support F&M model 2020-21.pdf" attached. 
This document describes the five stages of student teacher development as suggested by Maynard & Furlong (1995) and links these to possible development activities to support their training. 
In planning for the visit, I would therefore ask that you consider the stage of development at which you feel your student teacher currently sits (likely to be 1, 2 or 3) and which of the linked activities (on pages 5-11) would be the most appropriate to meet the training needs of both of you as mentor as well of those of the student teacher at this point in time.
The development activity that we undertake during my visit will therefore depend on where we feel that the student is at this stage in their professional journey.
I would suggest that the student joins us for this part of the visit.

I can then spend the final 30 minutes of the time allocation in discussion with the student.

It might also be appropriate for the Professional Mentor to join the conversation at some point during the visit, but this is not mandatory.

-- Dates --

I have listed below the dates when I am currently available to make this virtual visit.
The dates and times I currently have free are:

Monday 2nd November - at any time
Tuesday 3rd November - at any time
Wednesday 4th November - at any time

Monday 9th November - at any time
Tuesday 10th November - at any time
Wednesday 11th November - 9am to 12pm
Friday 13th November - at any time

Monday 16th November - at any time
Tuesday 17th November - at any time

In the light of the information above, I would be grateful if you would reply to me to indicate the following:
 - when, from the list above, might be a good time hold this virtual visit (we ideally need a 2 hour slot)
 - where you think your student might currently sit on the five stages of development as described by Maynard & Furlong
 - an indication of how you might like to make best use of the joint activity with the student with reference to those suggestions in visit-support pdf.

Given that I have sent this information out to all mentors in this first tranche of visits at the same time, I will "take bookings" (so to speak) on a first come, first served basis, so it would be prudent to respond to me at your earliest convenience to reserve a slot.

--

I look forward to coming into school and working with you in due course.

Kind regards,

### Initial visit (PGCE - second attempt)

Greetings PGCE Computing Mentors,

As the subject tutor for PGCE Computing, one of my roles is to support Computing mentors by undertaking a school visit.
All mentor visits this year will be 'virtual' and held online (with Microsoft Teams).

This is a supportive 'mentor facing' visit.
As the assessment process for student teachers has been overhauled this year, I may be able to offer more information about the new process. 
(Mentor documents are available on the mentor website http://ccccumentors.org.uk/ )

A suggested visit agenda (2 hours total?):
    45min? - Tutor and Mentor - Hello. Discussion about 'CCCU Curriculum 2020'
    45min? - Mentor,  Student teacher and Tutor- Mentioning activity (Mentor/Student to lead on a normal mentoring activity with Tutor contributing)
    30min? - Student Teacher + Tutor - Consultation on progress so far
    (The time allocation is flexible)

Rather than sending multiple emails between us to settle on a date/time, I've set-up a web booking system for creating MSTeams meetings linked to my calendar availability. You can book an appropriate timeslot for a 'virtual visit':
https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/PGCESDComputing@cccu.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/

It would be good to complete a 'virtual visit' with you before Friday 5th February.

I hope this term goes as smoothly as possible for you all.
I look forward to visiting you soon.


### Initial visit reminder

Mon 04/01/2021 16:34

Hi ??,
(??: All CCCU tutors were asked recently to include Professional Mentors in all communications with subject mentors)

Just checking in to ask how you and ??? are doing?
At the beginning of January I sent out an email offering a 'Virtual Mentor Visit' to help support you as a subject mentor (copied below - 4th Jan 16:34).
A milestone for MPR1 (Mentor Progress Report 1) is opening soon and is due to be completed on Friday 5th February.
Following my earlier invitation, let me know if a support visit would be helpful.

You can book a virtual mentor meeting with me on MSTeams with my online booking system
https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/PGCESDComputing@cccu.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/

Hope we can catchup soon.


Visit 2
-------


Subject: Computing Mentor Support/Checkin

Hi ???,
(cc'ing ??? as professional mentor as part of process)

Thank you for supporting ??? with his second placement.
??? has been with you a week now and hopefully is begging to settle and understand your school.
In our subject session on Friday ?he/she/they? spoke highly of your induction.

How are things going?
I hope ??? came prepared with ?his/her/they're? SPR1 and SPR2 documents and is aware of ?his/her/they're? targets.

As my role is to support your mentoring, I should be visiting each mentor at least once per placement.
I can be available for short catchups or we can take some time to jointly mentor (maybe timing this with your normal weekly mentor meeting as a longer visit).
Just letting you know that this support is here.
The best way to contact me is using my online MSTeams booking system.
https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/PGCESDComputing@cccu.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/

My suggestion would be let ??? settle for a few weeks and maybe we could arrange a mentor visit towards Easter?

Let's keep in touch.
