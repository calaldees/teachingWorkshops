> Evidence suggests the use of ‘metacognitive strategies’ – which get pupils to think about their own learning - can be worth the equivalent of an additional +7 months’ progress when used well.
> However, while the potential impact of these approaches is very high, particularly for disadvantaged pupils, less is known about how to apply them effectively in the classroom.

> metacognitive strategies should be taught in conjunction with specific subject content as pupils find it hard to transfer these generic tips to specific tasks.

* Teachers should support pupils to plan, monitor, and evaluate their learning
* Explicitly teach pupils metacognitive strategies, including how to plan, monitor, and evaluate their learning
* Teachers should verbalise their metacognitive thinking (‘What do I know about problems like this? What ways of solving them have I used before?’) as they approach and work through a task.
* dialogue needs to be purposeful, with teachers guiding and supporting the conversation 
* Carefully designed guided practice, with support gradually withdrawn as the pupil becomes proficient, can allow pupils to develop skills and strategies before applying them in independent practice.
* Metacognition shouldn’t be an ‘extra’ task for teachers to do but should be built into their teaching activities

Idea: Structured Meta-cognition for homework?

Volet described "metacognitive strategies" in teaching and learning as the use of metacognition elements to aid learning, including checking, planning, selecting, monitoring, evaluating and revising.

### Some ideas of mine

* What was the hardest thing about this project? Why was this the hardest thing? What skills would have helped you if you had had them? How would you have go those skills? What could you do in the next project to improve?
* Planning - Always seek to clarify the problem
    * How will you know the task is complete and works correctly?
    * Be clear about your expected inputs and outputs and why
    * Pro: Write your unittests before you start coding
* Assess yourself? peer assessment?
    * Number of lines of code
    * Readability (variable names)
    * Comments
* We are continuing this project next session - How can I prepare for next session?
    * What resources are available to you?
    * What action should I take?

You can tell your students all of these things, but would it be more powerful if you got them to ask themselves the questions first?

We should set time aside to explicitly teach/name/model metacognitive skills

    4. Expert teachers offered a meta-commentary throughout the lessons that had the aim of ensuring that students trusted the teachers to take them through the process of learning something new
    * > students developed something that I came to call subject agency – the ability of pupils to develop the capacity to do something with the knowledge for themselves. Subject agency reflected how the teachers were hugely motivated by their own love of the subject
    * > Expert teachers were thinking about the process of teaching using the metaphor of scaffolding as a temporary adaptive structure (Shvarts and Bakker, 2019).

    * Misconception 1: Meta-cognition is a general skill that should be taught separately from subject knowledge
    * Misconception 2: Meta-cognition represents ‘higher order’ thinking and is therefore more important than mere cognition or subject knowledge
    * Misconception 3: Meta-cognition is only developed in older pupils

> Metacognition shouldn’t be an ‘extra’ task for teachers to do but should be built into their teaching activities

TASK: 
1. Think about a lesson that you have observed in school. Were there any metacognitive elements?
2. How could you add a meta-cognitive element to this activity?

Note: I will expect to see evidence of meta-cognitive elements in your future lesson plans, observations, evaluations

* Opinion/Blog [Programmer’s emotions](https://blog.sidebits.tech/programmers-emotions/) Posted on 2021-10-30 by Milosz Danczak
    * From the outside, programmers seem to resemble the machines they program – cold, emotionless, unmoved.  But the reality is different – most moments in programming are full of emotions.
    * What are these emotions?
        * Confusion. Much of the time, I am confused by code. Something is working differently than I expect it to, or I can’t get my head around a line of code.
        * Anxiety. When the context of the project is stressful, deadlines are near, and I deal with a complicated piece of code, I tend to feel anxious.
        * Shame.  When I discover that something I wrote some time ago is faulty, I feel ashamed. Or when somebody finds an obvious mistake in my pull request.
        * Irritation.  When I am confused for too long, or somebody nit-picks my pull request. Or when something takes much longer than I expected – which happens often.
        * Hesitation.  Sometimes I feel like in a dead-lock, unable to decide between different choices with complicated or non-obvious trade-offs.
        * Inadequacy. When I need to step outside of my comfort zone, I am often baffled by how small that zone is. On a logical level, I know that I can’t know everything and nobody expects me to, but it still makes me feel bad.
        * Silliness.  Sometimes I find out that a solution to a problem is hiding in plain sight, and I feel silly.  It is often accompanied by relief.
        * Satisfaction. Every time something works the way I expected it to, a jolt of satisfaction kicks in.
        * Excitement.  When I discover a new way to do something.
        * Hope.  For a short moment in the middle of my feedback loop, when I just coded something and I’m waiting for the screen to refresh or for tests to pass.
        * Pride.  When I made something neat or something worked on the first attempt.
        * Relief.  When I solved a problem I had been struggling with for a long time.
    * Is experiencing emotions much different for different programmers? I don’t know; I have direct access only to my own emotions.
    * Are emotions bad? No. They are necessary to get going.
    * Some of them are harmful, and some of them are more useful than others.
        * Anxiety, inadequacy, and shame are just not helpful in programming.  It is good to reduce them if we can.
        * Confusion, irritation, and hesitation are rather negative emotions per se, but they can be useful or even necessary.
        * If you are missing something in your mental image, you should feel confused. That’s how you know you need to explore.
        * Irritation, in small amounts, can lead to positive action. But it only works if you are irritated by something within your control.
        * Hesitation can be harmful when you spend disproportional time making decisions, but some hesitation is useful to signal that you need to proceed carefully.
    * Positive emotions are obviously helpful.  They make the act of programming palatable for humans.
        * But they can also lead to non-optimal behaviors occasionally.
        * Programmers are often choosing things that are exciting rather than important. Chasing the newest frameworks and programming languages is a huge timesink.
        * Pride can cause us to ignore the shortcomings of an overall neat solution.
        * Relief may fool us to stop being careful.  And it never pays to be careless when programming.
    * What other emotions do you experience when programming? Do you experience emotions differently than I do?  Let me know.
