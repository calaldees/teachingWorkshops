Criticality

* [Achieving equity through mediocrity: Why elimination of gifted programs should worry us all](https://thehill.com/opinion/education/576491-achieving-equity-through-mediocrity-why-elimination-of-gifted-programs)
    * > Journalist H.L. Mencken once denounced public education as an effort “simply to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level, to breed a standard citizenry, to put down dissent and originality.”
* [The Push for Equity in Education Hurts Vulnerable Children the Most](https://quillette.com/2021/11/25/the-push-for-equity-in-education-hurts-vulnerable-children-most/) Russell T. Warne 2021
    * > The spending on education in the United States is disproportionately directed towards struggling children.
    * > Equity over excellence
* Goodhearts law - metrics will be gamed - if you truly want to reduce the attainment gap, just send the good students home 3 days a week
* [School Integration Limits the Ability of Local Norms to Diversify Gifted Programs: A Mathematical Analysis with Implications Related to the Achievement Gap](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1932202X211069078) 2022 Warne

        * > In this study, I show that selecting kids @ the building level for #gifted programs will only result in a diverse gifted program at the most segregated schools. At integrated schools, it results in a LESS diverse program. #education 


### Webinar Summary - How to Support the More Able

* [Webinar: How to Support All Learners Part 2: More Able](https://my.chartered.college/2020/11/webinar-how-to-support-all-learners-part-2-more-able/) Dr. Keith Watson
    * supports Early Career Teachers in

        * Resources behind a paywall - no individual signup path
        * [blog](https://www.nace.co.uk/page/blog)

    * _A lecture_ is the transfer of knowledge from the notepad of the lecturer to the notepad of the learner without engaging the brain
    * Get to know them - tap into their interests
    * How hard did they think - ask them 'scale of 1 to 10'
    * teddy 16cm,19cm,12cm how many would fit in classroom? How many golf balls in brazil?
    * How are you making them think?
    * > Standard 1: Set Goals that stretch and challenge pupils of all background, abilities and dispositions
    * 15% of highly able pupils who score in 10% nationally at age 11 fail to achieve in the top 25% at GCSE (Ofsted 2018)
    * Language _gifted_, _talented_, _skilled_, _clever_ (hidden meaning) - what is the policy in your school?
        * 10% of cohort?
        * gifted 0.5%
    * Cant rely on test scores - motivation, concentration
        * [Identifying more able learners: beyond the numbers](https://www.nace.co.uk/blogpost/1764163/327555/Identifying-more-able-learners-beyond-the-numbers)
    * Careful with labels (smart/gifted/talented)
        * More able are not used to failure - an emotional problem for many more able children
        * A label gives pressure to student?
    * Is it good to be clever? (social stigma)
    * Get them to Link things (mind map, )
    * Verbal and your dialogue - is powerful and immediate - written is not timely and seldom interpreted correctly
        * Is this in your lesson plan?
    * > Structured tinkering
    * I-PENCIL Keith Watson 2006 (can't find reference to this)
        * Independent
        * Plenary
        * Extended - You cant write Charles Dickens in 20min
            * Time? Independence?
        * Negotiated
            * Learners are part of the planning process
        * Cutaway
            * Brief, cutaway, lap to check, pullback+review/input, cutaway,
            * small interventions
        * Idiosyncratic
            * How well do you know them?
        * Listen
            * Dialogue about learning
    * When talking to the whole class - "Who do I need here now"
    * "Why is this important?" "What makes you think that?"
    * Signpost + encourage - point them in the right direction
        * External communities (BarCamp?)
        * Older pupils?
        * You a planting seeds
    * Describe
        * only allowed 10 words
        * only use shapes
    * Learning Theory is good, but don't become overly mechanical
    * "We have to worry about semi colons, but I want to write from the heart" year 10 pupil (referring to english)
    * If you were a font, which would you be?
    * When I teach you, what is it that I do that helps you?
    * Don't have your more able supporting the others a disproportionate amount of time
        * If it helps them clarify their ideas and knowledge, that's fine. Using them to make your life easier is just exploitation. What's in it for them?
    * Be careful of _public praise_
        * creates a social divide
        * create dependency on praise
    * Collaboratively create a wall display to conveys the class work this term?
    * Some students are hyper focused on one very narrow area
        * Keep signposting and gently encouraging outside of that area
        * Example
            * Lua+Roblox (and nothing else matter)
            * Web guy - lacks wider experience - everything is a DOM and javascript - everything!


### Expertise Reversal Effect

* Too much support for weaker learners can harm the most able
    * [Expertise Reversal Effect and its Instructional Implications](https://impact.chartered.college/article/expertise-reversal-effect-instructional-implications/) 2018
        * > ... a technique that reduces working memory load for low-knowledge learners (e.g. by providing strong instructional support) might lose its effectiveness and may even bring negative consequences for more knowledgeable learners; they may learn better in an environment with minimal guidance. This is known as the expertise reversal effect ...
        * > ... implication of the effect is the need to develop an adaptive learning environment in which learning materials are tailored in accordance with learners’ current levels of achievement ...


Strategies in Computing
-----------

TASK: 10min
* Round the room - can you describe one of your best students in lower secondary and upper secondary.
* Are there any common themes?


TASK: What strategies have you seen to support the more able?
(who are these able students? how were they identified? what support/strategies were put in place (if any?))
* Think (3min) notes
* Pair (5min)
* Share (5min)

<details>
<summary>some of my ideas</summary>

* Self paced task bank - stretch/extension (clearly graded)
* Use another language
    * (which is better for this task?)
* Add depth by considering Performance/LinesOfCode/Optimise
* Put together a case that is (deliberately) not your opinion
* Work on weakness's
    * `A*` but can't communicate or work in groups
    * Can go 'off spec' (in amazing ways) - do you allow this? or bring them back on track?
* (in the modern world) There are LOTS of amazing accessible resources.
* Teach them how to get a login for hack-the-box (after school)
Most importantly
* Be interested in their development! - however this can backfire because it's all they want to do and no other adult will listen.
