TODO:
* [Why a decade of knowledge-rich curriculum has not served pupils as promised](https://www.tes.com/magazine/analysis/general/why-decade-knowledge-rich-curriculum-has-not-served-pupils-promised)
    * > Ofsted's deep-dive investigation into subjects is to determine the extent of subject knowledge and whether the knowledge they find is substantive, disciplinary or inter-disciplinary.

    * > A secondary pupil measuring personal performance in PE might be making little progress in mathematic skills nor getting fitter. 
    * > Nowadays, the focus on the pedagogy of knowledge transmission indicates measurable progress in learning…a particular approach to pedagogy.
    * > The art of 'knowing why' ... the learning of the "what" will only go so far.
