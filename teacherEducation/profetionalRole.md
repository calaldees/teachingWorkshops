### Spotting Abuse

Our current Secondary Education system means it's difficult to get a holistic picture of a students overall experience.

Do not shy away from your responsibility's because you think "I'm not really trained in that".
You interact with 1000's of young people all day every day for your entire professional career.
You know what is abnormal.
You know when a students behaviour changes over short and long term.
Your duty of care extends beyond your subject knowledge.

Don't ignore warning signs - you are a professional.

Sometimes Parents do not want to acknowledge or know how to cope with a problem.

But how do you have the conversation with young people?
You are not supposed to talk about personal circumstances.

If they talk to you, before they divulge any personal information you must be very clear that you will talk to other staff if you think it is necessary.
You are never to be confided in and keep secrets. You must be transparent and unified with senior staff.
This is to protect yourself.

### Courageous Leadership

You have a duty of care over your students.

Your have some element of control over your teams emotional state.

I don't agree with the bluntness of his ethos, but I do resonate with the concept of 'you actions being a powerful agent for change'

Mentioning of Students

Your advice should be
* Free from judgement
* Not in allegiance with a political sphere
* Highlight areas of concern without them being instructions (young people hate instructions)

You are a role model - if you want them to be passionate and curious - you have to be passionate and curious
