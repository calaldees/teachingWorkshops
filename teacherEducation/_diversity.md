Define (15min)
------

* TASK: 
    * Write down in your own words definitions of the following terms (6min)
    * Compare them with a peer (3min)
    * (are you aligned?)
* Define
    * Diversity
    * Inclusion
    * Equality
    * Equity
* Difference between
    * Diversity and Inclusion?
    * Equality and Equity?

### Definitions 

(quick copy and paste from the web)

* Diversity
    * > the practice or quality of including or involving people from a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds and of different genders, sexual orientations, etc.
* Inclusion
    * > the practice or policy of providing equal access to opportunities and resources for people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized
* Equality
    * > the state of being equal, especially in status, rights, or opportunities.
* Equity
    * > education equity is based on the premise that an individual's level of education directly correlates to future quality of life. Therefore, an academic system that practices educational equity is a strong foundation of a society that is fair and thriving
* Diversity vs Inclusion
    * > Diversity refers to the traits and characteristics that make people unique while inclusion refers to the behaviors and social norms that ensure people feel welcome.
* Equality vs Equity
    * > Equality means each individual or group of people is given the same resources or opportunities. Equity recognizes that each person has different circumstances and allocates the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome.

Situation Discussion
--------------------

Mental thinking - upfront now - when a situation does occur we have some grounding for how to act

### Situation 1 (15min)

* Real school situation
    * [Head Tracking for Desktop VR Displays using the WiiRemote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd3-eiid-Uw)
    * I built the ir goggles + battery over the weekend and wanted to demo the technique
    * I started playing the video and one student remarked
        * > It's a chinky
    * What was the intension of the young person?
* TASK1: (Whole group consolidation) Think (2min) What actions could be taken? Why? (10min)


<details>

* Suggestion: 
    * Be prepared to drop all planned activities and focus on this more important topic
    * Don't use aggression to convey your urgency. Use enquiry.
        * What does aggression and authority convey in our hidden curriculum?
        * The fact you have completely stopped the previous activity already conveys the gravity of the situation
    * Have a plan - just talking may not be enough - 
        * Decide on the goal - vocalise the goal - write it
        * Other prep
            * Could you have paper printed? power-point ready?
</details>

* TASK2: (Pairs) Consider a diversity/inclusion situation that you may have encountered in school. What actions should be taken? Why? (10min)
    * Share with group (5min)



### Situation 2 (10min)

* Vertical tutor group - my form
* Socially alienated year 9
    * overweight
    * ADHD (difficulty focusing/remembering)
    * difficulty wearing uniform correctly
    * loud
    * effeminate voice
    * hygiene issues
* Pleasant manner and responsive to instructions
    * Repeated instructions
        * "I forgot"; repeated response
        * No impact or meaningful change in behaviour either short term or long term
* TASK: Consider strategies/action-plan for social integration for:
    * The student?
    * Parents?
    * Form group?
    * Subject teachers?
    * Wider school staff?
    * Other support?

<details>

* My form were between 'tolerant' to 'accepting' - One of us
    * peer - panner and pen check each day
    * The wider school was more challenging
</details>



When have you felt excluded? (15min)
----------------------------

* My PE story - teachers response (2min)
* Your story? Think Pair Share (10min)


Cultural alienation
-------------------

#### Adult/Employment Context (10min)

* > Did you see the game last night?
* As an illustration: Nursery rhymes - if you can - join in with me
    * Little Miss Muffit
    * Bar Bar Black sheep

Do any members of your team feel excluded, alienated, outsiders?

* Micro-aggression training from employers
    * (you are not a robot, but)
    * Keep talk at work focused on work 
    * Personally connecting with your colleagues one to one with a shared identity is ok.
    * More than two people; be mindful of others cultural alienation.
    * If this is sustained this could be considered a micro-aggression

(With this in mind - how does this transfer to the school context. School student communities are more than 2 or 3 adults in an office)

#### School Context

* Lesson Content
    * Decolonising the Curriculum
        * Ongoing discussions
    * Relevant to the students lives
        * Careers, Local Context, Community
    * Unconscious cultural assumptions
        * Your students are not you
        * My example in Computing: Games
            * > Teach with games - everybody loves games
            * > Please don't suggest a game ...
    * TASK: Personal reflection: What could be your unconscious cultural assumptions about your subject? (3min)
* Student interactions?
    * ???


### Name Pronunciation

    * > white-sounding names were 28% more likely to get a callback for a job interview. 
    * > “I’m sorry I mispronounced that. Could you please repeat your name for me?” 
    * > Don’t be arrogant or flippant. I’ve had a number of instances where people say, “I’ll never get it right — can I call you another name?” 
* Online service
    * a quick first attempt
    * [pronouncenames.com/Ruchika](https://www.pronouncenames.com/Ruchika)
* Research how to pronounce student names in advance
    * ECT year - pronounce their names correctly for the first lesson/register

Request for support and Advice - My Undergraduate class's
------------------

* Context
    * 1st year undergraduates
    * Introduction to programming
    * Lab size of 40 (another 40 online)
    * Workshop is 4 hours
* Set first task
* Many students peer support and engage
    * Culturally integrated
    * Confident
* Select few don't engage 
    * (with the task due to weak skills)
    * (socially - confidence?)
    * Withdrawn (hoody up)
    * Took me 40min to identify some of them
* Advised to actively engage and seek support
* This is the first task - what is the rest of their degree going to look like?

TASK: (10min)
* What do I do?



Unconscious Bias
----------------

![Cognative Bias Codex](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Cognitive_bias_codex_en.svg) 
<sub>from [designhacks.co](https://designhacks.co/)</sub>

* Unconscious Bias testing
    * Crude tests, but interesting
    * [Implicit Association Test (IAT)](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html)
        * Reaction time to association of images and words to uncover possible bias
        * 10min each (need quiet focused space to take them)
        * Lots of topics - religion, sexuality, etc


Unsorted
========

* Broaden your sources of opinion and information 
    * If someone is making an argument - ask them for the inverse - someone genuinely informed can answer this



* Who are the 5 people you interact with the most in school?
* Does the school staff reflect the school community? 
* Who might not feel included in the staffroom?




* [Tom Rogers](https://twitter.com/RogersHistory/status/1503725955516448771) @RogersHistory
    * > A seemingly popular take on ‘inclusion’ is that which allows someone who assaults or abuses a teacher to continue to be included.

* [Am I stuck in a local maximum?](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2021/08/09/am-i-stuck-in-a-local-maximum/#0d6d6bee68644d158deb5fa8cf478be7) Mark Seemann 2021
    * Anecdotal evidence
        * > This is a difficult discussion to have. I think that another reason that we keep returning to the same controversies is that we mostly rely on anecdotal evidence. As we progress through our careers, we observe what works and what doesn't, but it's likely that confirmation bias makes us remember the results that we already favour, whereas we conveniently forget about the outcomes that don't fit our preferred narrative.
        * > Could we settle these discussions with more science? Alas, that's difficult.
        * > I can't think of anything better, then, than keep having the same discussions over and over. I try hard to overcome my biases to understand the other side, and now and then, I learn something that I find illuminating. It doesn't seem to be a particularly efficient way to address these difficult questions, but I don't know what else to do. What's the alternative to discussion? To not discuss? To not exchange ideas? That seems worse.
