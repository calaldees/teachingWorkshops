* [ok plateau](https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/apr/11/expert-teachers-ok-plateau-professional-development) - Alex Quigley
    * > common autopilot state when you have habitually mastered the basics of a task, but despite being skilled you stop really improving to reach expert status; you simply plateau in performance
    * > With the storm of demands created by workload, any improvement beyond this point seemed fanciful. 
      > I stopped reading about teaching and learning and I stopped being coached with genuine regularity.

Leading Learning - EEF Example (30min)
----------------
#8-Wider-Learn-that-7-quality_cpd
* [Professional Development Leaders Conference 2023 - keynote Alex Quigley](https://stemlearning.wistia.com/medias/q399quqg66) 03:38 to 10:00 (5min)
    * Why use evidence ...
    * Read these two programs - which is more effective and why (03:38 to 04:20)
    * Programme 1
        * Whole-school improvement programme that aims to improve the academic and social outcomes of primary school pupils
        * Trained coaches deliver a bespoke two-year programme though monthly coaching sessions, focusing on leadership, learning, parental engagement and wider outcomes
        * There is also a specific focus on improving outcomes for a target group of children (which largely consist of the lowest 20% of attainers)
    * Programme 2
        * Aims to improve pupil engagement and attainment by improving the quality of classroom talk
        * Teachers are trained in strategies that enable pupils to reason, discuss, argue and explain rather than merely respond, in order to develop high order thinking and articulacy
        * The programme uses video review, print materials and in-school mentoring to support teachers' practice across English, maths and science lessons
<details>
<summary>The outcome of both programmes</summary>

05:25 to 10:00
CPD sustained over course of integration - at heart of each programme

* Programme 1 - "Achievement for All"
    * Whole-school improvement programme (monthy coaching sessions)
    * Very pupular - now bust - very intensive
    * Outcome (compared to control groups)
        * All pupils -2 months
        * Target pupils -2 months
* Programme 2 - Dialogic Talk
    * Teacher training to improve quality of classroom talk
    * Outcome
        * All pupils +2 months
        * FSM +2 months

Not every programme is successful, but CPD is vital.

Professional Placement (PP) Module
----------------------------------

* [2021-22 (S2) Professional Placement (Secondary) (U13557) A21U13557](https://learn.canterbury.ac.uk/ultra/courses/_17824_1/cl/outline) -> Learning Resources 
* Submission
    * 15min presentation, on campus, on Friday 10th June, in front of peers + colleagues
    * and submitted to TurnItIn
* Brief
    * "How can policy help students to make progress?"
        * You will need to explicitly identify ONE policy to look at:
            * Behaviour, Assessment, EAL, SEND, EqualityDiversityInclusion(EDI), Literacy (+ others). 
        * The policy could be:
            * a local one -  e.g. one developed specifically by your placement, 
            * a national one - e.g. DfE policy or it could be a school response to a national policy adapted for its own context.
        * Consider how/whether this policy supports progress and learning
            * using both your _experience_ and your _reading_
        * Citing one (or both) of your bundles as evidence
* Support
    * Online - 4 x Thursdays 17:30 to 18:30
        * 28th April - Launch
            * See video at 15min - Walkthroughs
        * 5th + 12th + 19th + 26th May - Policies (recommended!!!)
            * From school partners + tutors
    * Discuss policy with your mentor
* Leaning Outcomes (keep these in mind)
    1. The ability to critically evaluate and reflect consistently and routinely upon themselves, including their own practice and professional development practice, and that of others with reference to theory as well as identify aspects of their own professional learning, setting targets for development
    2. A systematic knowledge and critical understanding of key theoretical issues pertinent to their specific age phase such as learning and assessment theories, inclusion and English as an Additional Language (EAL) and to be able to apply and critically reflect upon this knowledge and its relationship to practice consistently and routinely in their professional practice
    3. A systematic knowledge and conceptual understanding of the impact that settings, environments, contexts and community have on learning in their specific age phase, and the ability to use, and critically reflect upon, this knowledge consistently and routinely in their professional practice
    4. A systematic knowledge and critical understanding of a wide range of conceptualisations of ‘effective teaching and learning’ in their specific age phase and to demonstrate how this impacts upon pupil progress and to demonstrate this knowledge routinely and consistently in their professional practice and in critical reflections.
* Hints
    * Why have they setup the policy in this way (literature?)

Student Experience
------------------

Next year ...

* > Please ask your students to create a 30 – 60 second talking head video of how they have developed their identity throughout the year, especially through dealing with difficult situations. These need to be sent to Steve and will be embedded in online induction materials.  
    * How did you resolve
    * MP4 on phone
* > Asking reps to ask students for ideas about setting up social opportunities and community groups. If you hear anything or have any thoughts, please share these with Steve.
* ECF Network - Keep in touch - Concept
