The Inclusion Conundrum
-----------------------

Education for all is seen as a human right

* Give equal time to all
    * Progress is a cumulative effect (the good just get better)
* Equity? Send all achieving students home (ignore the achieving)
    * old strategy - ignore the gcse students level >= 5
    * newer strategy - same, but for progress 8
* Reality - aim for the average
    * Everyone makes progress (but this progress is less than optimal)
        * Least damage to weak
        * Least damage to strong
        * Best average case
            * Weak never socially advance
                * as gap between weak and strong will never close
            * Strong are not exceptional
                * Countries economic output?
* Conundrum - stuck in the vortex of:
    * No attainment matters - everyone is an individual with skills/passion they can offer
    * (At the same time) attainment matters - stuff needs to get done and some tasks are so skilled they need a lifetime of training to get there

        * > Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils.

ITT CCF
-------

* Adaptive Teaching (Standard 5–‘Adapt teaching’)
    * Learn That
        1. Pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed
        2. Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success
        3. Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils
        4. Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential
    * Learn How to
        * Identifying pupils who need new content further broken down.
* Professional Behaviours (Standard 8–‘Fulfil wider professional responsibilities’)
    4. Building effective relationships with parents, carers and families can improve pupils’ motivation, behaviour and academic success
    5. Teaching assistants (TAs) can support pupils more effectively when they are prepared for lessons by teachers, and when TAs supplement rather than replace support from teachers.
    6. SENCOs, pastoral leaders, careers advisors and other specialist colleagues also have valuable expertise and can ensure that appropriate support is in place for pupils


SEND code of practice
---------------------

* 9 million children in eduction
    * SEN 1.4 million
    * Support plan 0.3 million
    * Special school 0.13 million

    * 1.24, 1.26
    * Pretty much all of section 6 (weighted towards the earlier points)

TASK 1: (15min)
* What are your responsibilities as a subject teacher?
    * Shared Doc
* A list of skills/training-needs you think you need to develop (You will use this list in your mentor meetings)

TASK 2: (15min)
PartA:
* What are the 4 broad areas of need - can you identify any traits/names to these areas?
PartB (15min - could be extended ...)
* What could we do in a Computing classroom to facilitate each of these possible traits/areas of need?
    * Would love to hear your personal experiences and contributions

Some of my remarks
* Many of the special schools have been closed - a wider spectrum of students are expected to attend mainstream education.
* Every teacher is a teacher of SEN and disabilities - we do not delegate to other teachers - we ARE the support
* We are an inclusive society

<details>
<summary>(Hidden) My Notes</summary>

* 1.24
    * High quality teaching that is differentiated and personalised will meet the individual needs of the majority of children and young people.
    * Some children and young people need educational provision that is additional to or different from this.
    * This is special educational provision under Section 21 of the Children and Families Act 2014.
    * Schools and colleges must use their best endeavours to ensure that such provision is made for those who need it.
    * Special educational provision is underpinned by high quality teaching and is compromised by anything less.
* 1.26
    * As part of its commitments under articles 7 and 24 of the United Nations Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the UK Government is committed to inclusive education of disabled children and young people and the progressive removal of barriers to learning and participation in mainstream education.
* Section 6: pg91 to pg110
* 6.2
    * ensure that children and young people with SEN engage in the activities of the school alongside pupils who do not have SEN
    * The quality of teaching for pupils with SEN, and the progress made by pupils, should be a core part of the school’s performance management arrangements and its approach to professional development for all teaching and support staff. School leaders and teaching staff, including the SENCO, should identify any patterns in the identification of SEN
    * The identification of SEN should be built into the overall approach to monitoring the progress and development of all pupils
* 6.12
    * All pupils should have access to a broad and balanced curriculum. 
    * The National Curriculum Inclusion Statement states that teachers should set high expectations for every pupil, whatever their prior attainment. 
    * Teachers should use appropriate assessment to set targets which are deliberately ambitious. 
    * Potential areas of difficulty should be identified and addressed at the outset. 
    * Lessons should be planned to address potential areas of difficulty and to remove barriers to pupil achievement. 
    * In many cases, such planning will mean that pupils with SEN and disabilities will be able to study the full national curriculum.
* 6.16
    * Schools should assess each pupil’s current skills and levels of attainment on entry, building on information from previous settings and key stages where appropriate
* 6.17
    * Class and subject teachers, supported by the senior leadership team, should make regular assessments of progress for all pupils. 
    * These should seek to identify pupils making less than expected progress given their age and individual circumstances
* 6.18
    * It can include progress in areas other than attainment – for instance where a pupil needs to make additional progress with wider development or social needs in order to make a successful transition to adult life
* 6.19
    * The first response to such progress should be high quality teaching targeted at their areas of weakness.
    * Where progress continues to be less than expected the class or subject teacher, working with the SENCO, should assess whether the child has SEN
* 6.21
    * Persistent disruptive or withdrawn behaviours do not necessarily mean that a child or young person has SEN. Where there are concerns, there should be an assessment to determine whether there are any causal factors such as undiagnosed learning difficulties, difficulties with communication or mental health issues. 
    * If it is thought housing, family or other domestic circumstances may be contributing to the presenting behaviour a multi-agency approach
* 6.22
    * Professionals should also be alert to other events that can lead to learning difficulties or wider mental health difficulties, such as bullying or bereavement.
    * Such events will not always lead to children having SEN but it can have an impact on wellbeing and sometimes this can be severe.
    * Schools should ensure they make appropriate provision for a child’s short-term needs in order to prevent problems escalating.
* 6.23
    * Slow progress and low attainment do not necessarily mean that a child has SEN and should not automatically lead to a pupil being recorded as having SEN. 
    * However, they may be an indicator of a range of learning difficulties or disabilities.
    * Equally, it should not be assumed that attainment in line with chronological age means that there is no learning difficulty or disability.
    * Some learning difficulties and disabilities occur across the range of cognitive ability and, left unaddressed may lead to frustration, which may manifest itself as disaffection, emotional or behavioural difficulties.
* 6.24
    * Identifying and assessing SEN for children or young people whose first language is not English requires particular care
* (6.28 -> 6.35) 4 areas of need
    * Communication / Interaction (6.28, 6.29)
        * Speech Language
        * Autism
        * Aspergers
    * Cognition (6.30, 6.31)
        * Learning difficulties
        * Specific learning difficulties
            * Dyslexic, Dispracsic
    * Social / Emotional (6.32, 6.33)
        * ADHD
        * Attachment Disorder
        * Self Harm
    * Sensory / Physical (6.34, 6.35)
        * Visual
        * Hearing
        * Physical
* 6.37
    * High quality teaching, differentiated for individual pupils, is the first step in responding to pupils who have or may have SEN.
    * Additional intervention and support cannot compensate for a lack of good quality teaching. 
    * Schools should regularly and carefully review the quality of teaching for all pupils, including those at risk of underachievement.
    * This includes reviewing and, where necessary, improving,teachers’ understanding of strategies to identify and support vulnerable pupils and their knowledge of the SEN most frequently encountered
* 6.45 Assess
    * ... subject teacher, working with the SENCO, should carry out a clear analysis of the pupil’s needs.
    * This should draw on the teacher’s assessment and experience of the pupil, their previous progress and attainment, as well as information from the school’s core approach to pupil progress, attainment, and behaviour.
    * It should also draw on other subject teachers’ assessments where relevant, the individual’s development in comparison to their peers and national data, the views and experience of parents, the pupil’s own views and, if relevant, advice from external support services.
    * Schools should take seriously any concerns raised by a parent.
    * These should be recorded and compared to the setting’s own assessment and information on how the pupil is developing.
* 6.49 Plan
    * All teachers and support staff who work with the pupil should be made aware of their needs, the outcomes sought, the support provided and any teaching strategies or approaches that are required. This should also be recorded on the school’s information system.
* 6.52 Do
    * subject teacher should remain responsible for working with the child on a daily basis. Where the interventions involve group or one-to-one teaching away from the main class or subject teacher, they should still retain responsibility for the pupil.
* 6.54 Review
    * The impact and quality of the support and interventions should be evaluated, along with the views of the pupil and their parents.
* 6.65
    * Where a pupil is receiving SEN support, schools should talk to parents regularly to set clear outcomes and review progress towards them
* 6.66
    * These discussions can build confidence in the actions being taken by the school, but they can also strengthen the impact of SEN support by increasing parental engagement in the approaches and teaching strategies that are being used
* 6.68
    * Conducting these discussions effectively involves a considerable amount of skill. As with other aspects of good teaching for pupils with SEN, schools should ensure that teaching staff are supported to manage these conversations as part of professional development.

Planning for Inclusion (30min)
----------------------

ITT CCF
* > 1.1 Teachers have the ability to affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of their pupils

Consider the Short, medium, long term actions for these students

> Alex is in year 11 and has moved to the school recently. They are currently transitioning gender and left their last school due to bullying. Alex's demeanour is anxious, shy, quiet and reserved. They are not social integrating well.

> Ahmed is in year 9 and is an elective mute. Based on their CAT/SAT's they are progressively underachieving each year. Ahmed is attentive and tries to engage with the work but is does not participate in group or class discussions well.

> Janice has poor attendance (87%). Often defiant to instructions. Rarely attempts homework. Year 10.

> Amina is very short sighted. Year 8. She hates being singled out and made to sit at the front, she feels unconfortable that everyone is looking at her. She always needs information repeated before she starts a task.

> Sina has english as a second language and always needs additional teacher support to start a task. They either complete programming assignments very well or fails to submit anything. Year 9.

> Brian (Year 7) can reason about tasks verbally, but types so slowly that he has been unable to complete 4 out of the 6 tasks in the space of the lesson this term. He has come back at lunchtime to finish his tasks.

> Add your own from your experience

### Mixed ability grouping

* [Patterns, Determinants, and Consequences of Ability Tracking: Evidence from Texas Public Schools](https://www.edworkingpapers.com/ai22-638)
    * > Schools often track students to classes based on ability.  .... we find positive effects on high-achieving students with no negative effects on low-achieving students, suggesting that tracking may increase inequality by raising the ceiling.

* [Mixed-attainment teaching: Careful steps towards better outcomes](https://impact.chartered.college/article/ehrlich_mixed-attainment-teaching-outcomes/) May 2018 Impact- Chartered College of Teaching
    * > children working in groups with others working at the same level of attainment – has been found to have a number of negative impacts on pupils, yet teachers often cite it as necessary for differentiating and meeting targets (Francis et al., 2017)
    * > As I feared, switching to mixed-attainment groupings initially proved to be a nightmare. Higher attainers dominated, lower attainers withdrew, arguments arose and little work seemed to get done.
    * Group composition
    * Student skills to develop
        * listening, sharing and respecting each other’s right to learn were all identified as being areas in need of work
        * highlights specific children who might need extra help developing these skills. This can be done through individual discussions and interventions.
        * treat pupils fairly (don't let high attainers get away with bad behaviour)
    * Lesson design
        * A lot of time was spent thinking about how to create lessons that were more open-ended and less teacher-centred, and which involved pupils having specific roles. Once this becomes the norm, it is no lengthier than designing three different tasks for your ‘tops, middles and bottoms’.
        * Open-ended tasks are far more successful at challenging all levels when planned well. In redesigning learning tasks, by using targeted questions and designated roles and allowing pupils to select their own level of challenge
        * the introduction of meta-learning and empowering pupils to take control of their learning
    * Impact on behaviour
        * as well as stepping back from the learning, teachers can step back from behaviour management too. Perhaps partly because of reduced anxiety about performing in the ‘top’ group or being stuck in the bottom group, pupils who initially misbehaved in group work stopped doing so. Having pupils determine learning rules and uphold them among each other also developed far better behaviour throughout the class. This, combined with the focus on meta-learning and encouraging respect for each other as learners, provides opportunities for pupils to take more responsibility for their own learning and make a real contribution to the group

> 2.5 Explicitly teaching pupils the knowledge and skills they need to succeed within particular subject areas is beneficial.

NOTE: Starting with a 'task' is bad form. We will have a second opportunity to tackle this.

* (tutor lead) Demo [makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org/) [rock-paper-scissors game](../physicalProgramming/microbit/rock_paper_scissors.py) (5min)
* (individual) Explore the  Code (10min)
    * Run it yourself. What is it doing? How does it work?

* Imagine you need to deliver this project as a directed task to a KS3 class
* (pairs) How would you 'differentiate' this project for a mixed group? (20min)
    * What support/scaffolds/resources/tasks would need to prepare for the weaker students?
    * What support/scaffolds/resources/tasks would need to prepare for the advanced students?
    * Would students work as individuals? Would you group students? How would they work in a group?


### Interlude - Food for thought - Course construction and meeting the needs of learners (15min)

ITT CCF
* > 1.3 Teacher expectations can affect pupil outcomes; setting goals that challenge and stretch pupils is essential.
* > 1.4 Setting clear expectations can help communicate shared values that improve classroom and school culture
*  learn that 
* > Receiving clear, consistent and effective mentoring in how to set tasks that stretch pupils, but which are achievable, within a challenging curriculum

* [How to Think Inclusively About Computer Science Initiatives](https://www.thinkinclusive.us/computer-science-initiatives/)
    * > differentiation is not about long nights of planning and grading, but about being flexible and making decisions in the moment based on what your students need
    * > it (computing) should not be mandatory
    * [Differentiating Instruction: It’s Not as Hard as You Think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7-D3gi2lL8) (4min30sec)
        * Differentiate in 3 areas - Carol Tomlinson
            * content
                * student choose research title or essay prompts
                * the goal is the learning objectives - not the task
            * process
                * group students
                * different environment? (sit on a desk?)
            * product
                * doodling? make it about the topic
        * No extra time required
        * Requires relationship with students
        * Flexible thinking
        * Strong class culture


### Constructive Alignment of Assessment

ITT CCF
* > 6.2 Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear

Students focus is "what's in the assessment". Everything else is meh.

* [Aligning teaching for constructing learning](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/sites/default/files/resources/id477_aligning_teaching_for_constructing_learning.pdf) John Biggs
* [Course Design: constructive alignment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5hpRX5ZeIc) (Biggs 1999) (3min)
    * Constructive alignment (all the below should be aligned) - can start with any of these
        * Define - Intended learning outcomes (central component)
            * > Statements written from students perspective, indicating the level of understanding of the performance they are expected to achieve as a result of the learning experience <sub>(Bigs and Tang)</sub>
            * > They will learn what they think they will be assessed on, not what is in the curriculum, or even on what has been 'covered' in class. The trick is, then, to make sure the assessment tasks mirror the intended learning objectives
            * Action verbs - design, plan, analyse, evaluate, define, test, combine
        * Teaching/Learning Activities
        * Assessment Feedback Tasks

### Inclusive Differentiation

* [Inclusive Differentiation](https://youtu.be/aPTZpLaJvUA?t=2545) 42:40 to 47:17 Wilam talk excerpt
    * Q&A with Dylan Wiliam at Embedding Formative Assessment SSAT/EEF Celebration Event
    * Teacher introduces rule (if lucky teacher might explain why) - students reproduce 20 times
    * In japan one method - students in groups come up with as many ways as possible - 13 ways (Japanese teachers know this)
    * Differentiation comes from the teacher asking probing questions and ramping up cognitive demand
    * not separate tasks - teacher stretching groups

### Cooperative and Problem-Based Learning

* [Strengths and weaknesses of cooperative and problem-based learning](https://my.chartered.college/2019/10/strengths-and-weaknesses-of-cooperative-and-problem-based-learning/) Chartered College of Teaching - Research Digest 2019
    * Cooperative Learning (CL) and Problem-Based Learning (PBL)
    * Strengths
        * Increases responsibility over their learning. Self-directed learning skills, Self-confidence and motivation.
        * Active participants in their learning, sharing and exchanging ideas
        * Increased positive attitude. Feels easier for them to learn.
    * Weakness
        * Much more time to be implemented properly
        * Difficult to manage
        * Difficult to choose balanced groups that work well together
        * Confusing for some students - as they are unclear as to what is being asked of them

### CDIO

* Conceive Design Implement Operate ([CDIO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDIO_Initiative))
    * The CDIO Initiative is an educational framework that stresses engineering fundamentals set in the context of conceiving, designing, implementing and operating real-world systems and products.

#### Part 2 - Next step? (40min)

The previous directed task serves as a skill foundation.
The real project would be the next step.

* (groups of 3?) (30 min)
    * How would you construct a task to follow-on the rock-paper-scissors project?
    * What would the task(s) be?
    * How would you motivate all learners to engage with the topic?
    * How would you support the weaker and more advanced students? (Inclusion is the important bit!!!!)
    * How would you consider _constructive alignment_ of assessment?
* Your group should present your ideas to the other group - elect a spokesperson (10min)

#### Part 3

ITT CCF
* > 3.? learn-that Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues the rationale for curriculum choices, the process for arriving at current curriculum choices and how the school’s curriculum materials inform lesson preparation
* > 4.4 Guides, scaffolds and worked examples can help pupils apply new ideas, but should be gradually removed as pupil expertise increases
* > 4.9 Paired and group activities can increase pupil success, but to work together effectively pupils need guidance, support and practice.

My Tips

* Model meta cognition commentary in solving the problem
* Some Open ended tasks? 
    * Set the problem - 'create a program to'
* Some Creative tasks?
* Collaboration
* Independence/Autonomy
* Dialogue

When talking to your whole class, think "Who do I need here now?" Is to too high level for some? is it too low level for others?

(I will unveil my own hypothetical concept suggestions)

My other examples
* Excel - roleplay project

    * Character sheet generation
        * VLOOKUP, RAND, form controls, MAX. MIN, absolute cell references
        * Level - stats - skills - spells

Lesson Planning
---------------

* Every lesson I relay to students
    * All - of you will
    * Most - of you should
    * Some - of you could
    * (How will you as a teacher know this? you should make a note of % for each of these categories - maybe even some names)
* Reality
    * Plan for 10% absence from every session
    * Explicitly describe in your lesson plan 'What you will do for students that missed last session' (even name them in your plan?)
* Plan for TA


Inclusion Concept: Vertical Tutoring?
-------------------------------------

* Experiments have been done in schools to break traditional year groups.
* Form time includes small community's of students from all years.
* Research shows that facilitating peer mentoring creates improvements
    * [Peer tutoring](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evidence-summaries/teaching-learning-toolkit/peer-tutoring/)
        * cross-age tutoring, in which an older learner takes the tutoring role and is paired with a younger tutee or tutees;
* Reading

    * [Vertical Tutor Groups - Yes or No?](https://community.tes.com/threads/vertical-tutor-groups-yes-or-no.776609/)

TASK: (15min total)
* Put a table with 2 columns in the google doc
    * possible benefits of vertical tutoring
    * possible problems with vertical tutoring
* (Conduct your own discussion without tutor support)



Inclusive Society?
------------------

Discussion:
You have read that as teachers we are duty-bound to include all students of all possible ability's, backgrounds, races, genders, disabilities, ethnicity's, etc.
We are an inclusive society.

TASK: (15min)
With that in mind ... carefully discuss as a group the role of
* Single sex schools
* Grammar schools
* Special schools (do you as a teacher have the skills/training to support all of the required needs?)

* If you separated children based on other attributes - there would be an outcry. Why are some separations acceptable?


Disadvantaged Students
----------------------

TASK: What is [Pupil-Premium](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pupil-premium/pupil-premium)? (10min)
You tell me

<details>
<summary>(Hidden) My summary</summary>

* extra £1000 per students classed as FSM or in care
* NOT related to ability
* Money can be spent on 'all pupils' not just eligible ones
* Average - a school of 1000 could have 100 PP == £100,000?
</details>

* [Pupil Premium](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pupil-premium/pupil-premium)
    * Publicly-funded schools in England get extra funding from the government to help them improve the attainment of their disadvantaged pupils.
    * Evidence shows that children from disadvantaged backgrounds:
        * generally face extra challenges in reaching their potential at school
        * often do not perform as well as their peers
    * The pupil premium grant is designed to allow schools to help disadvantaged pupils by improving their progress and the exam results they achieve.
    * Schools get ... £935 for every secondary age pupil, who claims free school meals, or who has claimed free school meals in the last 6 years.
    * Schools get £2,300 for every pupil who has left local authority care through adoption
* [New measures to support disadvantaged children in schools](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-measures-to-support-disadvantaged-children-in-schools)
    * > with every classroom having three children who have come into contact with a social worker
    * > The EEF’s new guidance on how to spend it rightly emphasises recruiting, retaining and developing great teachers
    * > Pupil Premium must not become a cause of unnecessary work for teachers
* [EEF: Pupil Premium Guide](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evidence-summaries/pupil-premium-guide/)
    1. Teaching
        * Professional development
        * Recruitment and retention
        * Support for early career teachers
            * > Weekly individual coaching sessions help to support teachers and subject-specific CPD improves the quality of our pedagogical content knowledge
    2. Targeted academic support
        * Structured interventions
        * Small group tuition
        * One-to-one support
    3. Wider strategies 
        * Behaviour approaches
        * Breakfast clubs
        * Increasing attendance
    * (Some Quotes)
        * wellbeing
            * weekly 1:1 counselling sessions, Occupational Therapy-based interventions
        * communication 
            * (e.g. transport for parents to attend annual reviews, support for pupils to access a range of offsite trips and experiences); 
        * achievement (e.g. individual and small group tuition, personalised homework support and online learning packages) 
        * independence (e.g. weekly work experience opportunities for individuals)

### Metrics of disadvantage?

* Free school meals - important metric!
    * Some parents don't know they can apply for this
* Attendance?
    * moving home? devoice?
* Social Services? foster?
    * [Throwaway Kids: We are sending more foster kids to prison than college](https://www.kansascity.com/news/special-reports/article238206754.html)
* Number of excursions/interventions?
    * Detentions?

Models of Disability
--------------------

Cultural Values Dictate Disorders

* [Introduction to the Social and Medical Models of Disability](https://www.ombudsman.org.uk/sites/default/files/FDN-218144_Introduction_to_the_Social_and_Medical_Models_of_Disability.pdf)
    * Disablism == stereotypes of disabled people
    * Medical model -> person needs to change/adapt -> anxious, wheelchair, lazy
        * > Underlying the medical model is the belief that the difficulties associated with a disability should be borne wholly by the disabled person, 
            > and that the disabled person should make an extra effort (perhaps in time, effort, money, etc.) to ensure they do not inconvenience anyone else. 
            > They must change and adapt to fit the circumstances and their environment such as attending university.
    * Social model of disability -> person needs support -> low-income, negative attitudes, badly designed buildings
    * > your responsibility to ensure that your learning and teaching activities and materials are accessible.

            * > This experiment highlights the problems inherent in running mixed-ability classes, and makes it clear that any techniques used to increase access to participation for the students on either side of the class average (in terms of ability) will only ever be compromises.

Gender
------

* [Female Performance and Participation in Computer Science: A National Picture](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3366016) Kemp 2019
    * > Female participation remains a concern in most jurisdictions, but female attainment in CS is relatively unstudied
    * > we find that females from the poorest areas were more likely to take CS than those from the richest areas and that CS was more popular among ethnic minority females than white females
    * > CS females typically got better grades than their male peers. However, when controlling for average attainment in other subjects, males got 0.31 of a grade higher. Female relative underperformance in CS was most acute among large female cohorts and with girls studying in mixed-gender schools
    * > The move to introduce CS into the English curriculum and the removal of the ICT qualifications look to be having a negative impact on female participation and attainment in computing. Using the theory of self-efficacy, we argue that the shift towards CS might decrease the number of girls choosing further computing qualifications or pursuing computing as a career. Computing curriculum designers and teachers need to carefully consider the inclusive nature of their computing courses.

TODO? Where to put this?
Don't use the word _ability_. This implies a ceiling. Use the word _attainment_
