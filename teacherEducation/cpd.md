CPD
===

DfE: only 11% of CPD is effective (ciration? heard this on 30/03/2023 Chris Carr STEM PDL leaders conference)

* Effective CPD (Continued Professional Development)
    * Measuring impact
    * Sharing good practice
    * Networking with other Computing practitioners


Overall: Improving as a teacher throughout your career
Why: Because we don't know everything and the world changes

## ITT Core Framework
> 8.1
> Effective professional development is likely to be sustained over time, involve expert support or coaching and opportunities for collaboration.

> 8.2
> Reflective practice, supported by feedback from and observation of experienced colleagues, professional debate, and learning from educational research, is also likely to support improvement

> 8.7
> Engaging in high-quality professional development can help teachers improve


_Early Career Teacher_ (ECT) Years
==================================

The DfE has setup national standards for your support and progress in your _Early Career_ years.

TASK: [DfE Early Career Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework) (2019)

> all trainees an entitlement of three year support in their early years

* Same teachers' standards
* Support you are entitled too

* Observations - Key feature of ECF years - Two way street!
* They know you're new. Don't feel worried.

* In your ECT year: The _bike stabilizers_ are off. You've got your drivers licence. Now the learning can begin.


Personal Development / Actions for next year (30min async + 30min lecture)
--------------------------------------------

* Impact - chartered college of teaching -  [Building subject-specific CPD opportunities](https://impact.chartered.college/article/building-subject-specific-cpd-opportunities/) - Laura Gatward September 2020
    * Ideas for building subject-specific CPD:
        * Keep in contact with previous colleagues
        * Join your subject association (including their social media channels)
        * Contact your local university/college outreach department
        * Read about (and listen to/watch!) your subject
        * Work with other local departments
        * Use the evidence to highlight the importance of this with your leadership team.


### Action Today (Async 30min)

* We are going to do something *NOW* to improve our teaching in the future.
* Let's lay some foundations.

1. Prepare for writing a blog article
    * Set a target to write one article in your NQT year and have it publicly visible
    * TASK: Investigate blog platform - sign up - if you already have an account with a blog platform, this will be in the back of your mind

        * Other?
    * TASK: Consider a loose blog article title or theme
2. Prepare an action research question
    * TASK: Consider 2 hypothetical questions that you would like to know about _learning computing in schools_
        * Could you gather data during your year. How?
        * E.g. Why do students in your school choose Computing at GCSE? Why did students not choose computing at GCSE?
3. Listen to the big influencers in teaching - Twitter
    * Twitter is a problematic social platform - but as a professional tool it is very useful
    * TASK: Identify and follow 3 influential teachers on Twitter

Action in your _Early Career Teacher_ years  (15min)
-----------------------

* What do you want you CV to look like? (longer term - what's missing?)
* Small token actions that mount up
* Talking points at an interview for a future role

### 1 day plans

* Organize 1 day in a feeder primary school
* Run 1 workshop (30min) for staff in your school
    * TASK: think of a specialist area you might be able to present that would be useful to other teachers
* Organize 1 external speaker for an exam class
    * TASK: Identify 2 possible people in your social network who could talk about their professional role
* Run 1 after school thing for students
    * What cool topic in Computing does not really fit the curriculum, but would be worth showing/doing?
    * TASK: 
* Attend 1 teacher meet
    * CAS Hub meet?
    * Request exam board training - Network!

5 days in a year. You can make time for that.

TASK: Put placeholders in your personal calendar for the above days next year academic year 
(any placeholder date will do - this is just to put it on your radar - you will encounter the calendar events at somepoint to remind you or rebook)


Ongoing Observation/Collaboration (10min)
---------------------------------

Actively seek out coaching relationships with other teachers

* Instructional Coaching - [Top-down observation and feedback models are flawed. Time for change](https://teacherhead.com/2020/01/25/top-down-observation-and-feedback-models-are-flawed-time-for-change/) @teacherhead
    * > I’m now working on the principle that observers can only form hunches, opinions and offer ideas… this info only turns into feedback of any value once it’s been filtered by the teacher and meshed into their existing plans of action and sense of the problems they face.
    * > I’d willingly concede that most of the top-down fly-by feedback I’ve given over the years has been ignored or wrong with no impact on teaching quality. 
    > Because I was giving it – not helping the teacher to generate it; imposing my agenda, not helping the teacher with theirs.
    * > In my experience, leaders under all the pressure the accountability system has sent their way, have developed an over-inflated sense of the value and impact of their lesson observations.
* [Leverage observations](https://improvingteaching.co.uk/2014/12/15/archimedean-leadership-2-what-are-leverage-observations-or-how-would-yo-yo-ma-feed-back/) 2014 Harry Fletcher-Wood
    * Requirements
        * Frequency
            * Weekly observations support the introduction, adaptation and embedding of changes
        * Judgment
            * No evaluation is made: the sole purpose is improvement
        * Too many targets
            * Feedback focuses on one action step: the most powerful ‘lever’
        * Sufficient guidance
            * The observer helps the teacher pinpoint problems and solutions; teachers are ‘given’ an answer if they struggle to reach it themselves
        * Struggle implementing change
            * teachers practice the action step with their coach
        * Lack of follow-up
            * The next week’s observation coaches look for evidence of the action step
        * Superficiality/burden
            * one could claim superficiality, although I’d contend regular visits allow observers to familiarize themselves with teachers and classes; they add no planning or reporting burden.
    * We are trying to break the _ok plateau_.
        * *Change something* even if you think it will have little impact, it's not forever. explore, experiment, change, grow.
* [One-off lesson observations are a waste of everyone's time...](https://twitter.com/TeacherToolkit/status/1451147666910482433)
    * Grading teachers with one-off observations is flawed
* [Act now, check later: the power of uncertain inferences](https://improvingteaching.co.uk/2022/01/23/act-now-check-later-the-power-of-uncertain-inferences/)
    * > The quest for certainty is flawed. Effective decision-making is uncertain, humble but rapid.
    * Doing is better than not doing

Good interventions are - sustained - and lead to actually doing!

### Extra notes about colleague collaboration (some of my thoughts)

Mostly; Teachers have enough subject knowledge. It's the other skills they need to develop.

* Tacit knowledge
    * Can you learn to sing from a book alone?
    * How many hours would you contribute?
    * You can make some progress by self observation, but you NEED to collaborate/feedback/engage with others
* ECT's are very important to a department
    * You may be coming into an established department with established teachers. 
    * Part of your role is to bring new ideas and a new perspective.
    * You will play a major part in driving the culture forward - you are part of forging it - Be the change you want to be.


Sharing/PublishingResources Marketing/Branding Yourself - Ideas  (10min)
----------------------------------

### Why

* You help 30 young people at a time?
* What about 100? 1,000? 10,000?
* As Teachers, you are 
    * All on the same team
    * All with the same objective
    * and paid from the same pot of money
* Share your resources!
* (the sinister side) perception (self promotion, marketing, self brand)

### How

* Publish your stuff (otherwise nobody will know that you exist)
    * Internally
        * Your department / school
    * Externally
        * personal webserver
        * public dropbox / google drive
        * school website
    * Blog? Observations about the profession? Commentary?
* Grow/Evolve Resources (the world now knows you exist - what's in it for you)
    * Encourage contributions from
        * From other Teachers
        * Students (for corrections)?
        * The wider world
    * How would you collaborate with other teacher on resources?
        * Organic Feedback/Comments (they speak to you or email you)
        * Cloud document?
            * comments only
        * Version control (git)

* [ComputingTeachers.uk](https://ComputingTeachers.uk)
    * My exceptionally early concept of teacher resource collaboration with GitHub
        * TODO: need a brand identity, logo, color scheme
        * No hierarchy, two github approvers to merge pull request
        * Static site deploy of blog articles + resources
            * Generate Site, Presentations, pdfs from Markdown
    * [github.com/ComputingTeachers](https://github.com/ComputingTeachers)

Continued Professional Development (CPD)  (30min collaboration + 30min lecture)
========================================

Teaching Adults

* You are now experienced at teaching young people
* You will be constantly learning throughout your teaching career
* At some point in the future you will be receiving/giving CPD

* QUESTION (10min): How would your teaching be different when you are: teaching adults, teaching teachers?
    * Think, pair, share

<details>

Some of my thoughts:
* Much less available contact time?
    * Busy work - treading water - at your limit
* Do their objectives align with yours?
* Coaching/Collaboration (less didactic)
</details>


History of Computing CPD  (5min)
------------------------

* 2013 - Computing National Curriculum nationwide introduced
    * ICT teachers were told 'teach computing'
        * ICT is not Computing. Senior Leadership didn't really know the difference
        * No one was really sure how you would teach computing on such a scale
* 2016 - Education secretary said
    * > We will have 400 master teachers to deliver the new Computing Curriculum
        * [400 Master Teachers](https://schoolsweek.co.uk/3m-on-and-where-are-all-the-master-teachers/)
            * £3m on and where are all the master teachers?
        * The _master computing teacher_ program was failed/abandoned
            * Teachers not allocated time to share practice
            * No incentive for schools to donate teacher time
            * Experience varied
            * No measure of impact
    * > Deregulate QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) to let schools employ experts
        * [Curse of the expert](https://www.theconfidentteacher.com/2013/10/michael-gove-wrong-qualified-teacher-status/)
            * Experts in subject areas does not make them good teachers


Effective CPD (30min)
-------------

* You're a full time teacher. You're exhausted. Your time is full: making and planning, personal family commitments.

TASK (10min):
* Shared Whiteboard - split screen in half 'Good CPD' and 'Bad CPD'
    * Good CPD: What would your dream CPD session look like? What would it look like?
        * area you would like CPD to personally address/support you
    * Bad CPD: Can you give 2 examples of what does poor CPD looks like? (From your worldly experience; not necessarily applied to teaching)

<details>

### Poor CPD
One off inspirational speakers are not effective
Story: Theatre troupe. Shakespeare - dark day before the bridge

### Blockers to good CPD
* Culture
    * Nobody around you is displaying the right growth behaviour
    * How do you swim against the current?
        * Model the change/behaviour you want to see. (make the culture)
* Time
* No incentive to improve
    * Things are mostly ok (see _ok plateau_ below)

</details>

### DfE Standard for teachers’ professional development

Teacher CPD is a big area of focus and research now. The DfE now has requirements for CPD given to teachers.

* [DfE Standard for teachers’ professional development](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standard-for-teachers-professional-development) (2016)
    * Professional development should:
    1. have a *focus on improving and evaluating pupil outcomes*
        * Make sure they are clear about the intended outcomes of activities
        * Continually apply formative assessment to monitor progression and impact
        * Choose complementary activities aligned to a clear overall objective for their practice, pupils and school
    2. be *underpinned by robust evidence* and expertise
        * Seek to understand how and why practices work and how to implement them successfully in different contexts
        * Actively seek formative feedback on practice and support the evaluation of impact on their practice, pupil outcomes and wider school improvement
        * Expect to improve pedagogical knowledge AND subject knowledge, or specialist knowledge (e.g. for special educational needs)
    3. *include collaboration* and expert challenge
        * Seek expert support and challenge
        * Seek activities that allow adaptation of approaches for the classroom through practice
        * Implement practices with peers and focus discussion on the impact on pupils
    4. Programmes should be *sustained* over time
        * Seek programmes that typically last at least two terms and which provide a sustained rhythm of ongoing support.
        * Translate ideas into relevant practice and knowledge for specific classes and pupils, making time for ongoing practice and review.

    And all this is underpinned by, and requires that:

    5. must be *prioritised by school leadership*
        * Take responsibility for their own professional development
        * Engage openly in discussion about the impact of teaching practice with peers and leaders supporting a culture of trust, respect and scholarship
        * Fully commit to effective professional development practices and challenge poor or ineffective ones


### HOD Department CPD Idea? (30min)

If I was HOD of a computing department. I am interested in culture/process. I am not too worried about 'raw performance'. I am more concerned with proactive attitude and progress. I'm training them to leave my team (maybe to run their own department) [sounds crazy, but that's the reality, admit it, run with it].

Timetabled time (20 hours - half a ks3 class?)

1. 'Explore time' (16 hours - per year)
    * I would mandate that 30min a week (cumulative) is used to undergo an online course of some sort.
        * Self directed (autonomy and personal interest of the teacher)
            * e.g. Future Learn [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.futurelearn.com/partners/raspberry-pi)
    * At the end of each term, every member of the department informally describes the course/experience/content (10min?). Maybe loads up some of the documents or has a screenshot to prompt the talk.
        * If good enough and comfortable - share exactly the same informal demo with another department team (and suggest reciprocation?)
2. Inter institution collaboration (3 hours - per year)
    * I would mandate that 30min a term (6 terms) - you have a video call with another computing teacher in another institution to discuss our sow, policies, progress, concerns, action-areas - and hear the same from them - advice?
    * At the end of each term (3 terms), every member of the department informally (120seconds) describes what was discussed and highlights from these conversations

Even if your HOD does not direct you to do these ... I would do them autonomously.

TASK: Take a contact of two people in this room now! Put a date to get in touch in your personal calendar.

A Team? Other concepts
1. multiple teachers in the department do the assignment
    * to create model answers bank
    * and discuss (assessment/misconceptions)
2. Pair planning? (30min per week)
3. Pair Marking? (30min pwe week)


* impact.chartered.college - [Leading teacher collaboration in subject-specific pedagogy](https://impact.chartered.college/article/leading-teacher-collaboration-subject-specific-pedagogy/) 2020
    * > To support collaboration between teachers, leaders need to allocate resources and time. Literature indicates that this is a genuine issue in teacher development (Timperley et al., 2007; Greany, 2017; OECD, 2019). To give this work priority, all teaching staff attend a weekly session for one hour after school. This replaces the department meeting. To emphasise our identity as a professional learning community, we hold our sessions in the school hall and teachers sit in their specialisms.
    * > investing in teacher learning has an effect size of 0.84 on student achievement (Robinson, 2011)
    * > subject leaders focus their teams on a single lesson to be taught the following week
    * > Teachers then write a model answer for the end-of-unit assessment task
      > ...
      > Having been through the steps needed to produce the model answers themselves, teachers are able to give clear and detailed explanations and anticipate where misconceptions arise (Rosenshine, 2010; Coe et al., 2014).

TASK1 (10min): Think (solo) of how you would run your dream Computing department
TASK2 (10min): Roleplay - asked to come to front and address your Computing team (thats us) for the year ahead

        2. Take on any initiative, and ask everyone who put effort into it whether they feel it worked. No-one wants to feel their effort was wasted.
        3. Define ‘improvement’ in terms of perceptions and ratings of teachers. DO NOT conduct any proper assessments – they may disappoint.
        4. Only study schools or teachers that recognise a problem and are prepared to take on an initiative. They’ll probably improve whatever you do.
        5. Conduct some kind of evaluation, but don’t let the design be too good – poor quality evaluations are much more likely to show positive results.
        6. If any improvement occurs in any aspect of performance, focus attention on that rather than on any areas or schools that have not improved or got worse (don’t mention them!).
        7. Put some effort into marketing and presentation of the school. Once you start to recruit better students, things will improve.
    * Four Suggestions
        1. (Suggestion) Get teaching really focussed on learning
            * Poor proxies for learning
                * Students are busy: lots of work is done (especially written work)
                * Students are engaged, interested, motivated
                * Students are getting attention: feedback, explanations
                * Classroom is ordered, calm, under control
                * Curriculum has been ‘covered’ (ie presented to students in some form)
                * (At least some) students have supplied correct answers (whether or not they really understood them or could reproduce them independently)
        2. (Suggestion) Invest in effective professional development
            * Intense: at least 15 contact hours, preferably 50
            * Sustained: over at least two terms
            * Content focused: on teachers’ knowledge of subject content & how students learn it
            * Active: opportunities to try it out & discuss
            * Supported: external feedback and networks to improve and sustain
            * Evidence based: promotes strategies supported by robust evaluation evidence
        3. (Suggestion) Use multiple sources of validated evidence to support diagnostic and constructive evaluation of teacher quality
        4. (Non negotiable) Whenever we make a change we must try to evaluate its impact as robustly as we can

Teachers should
* retain considerable autonomy over their development
* avoid extensive monitoring for its own sake. un-intrusive, meaningful ways to know how teachers are improving
* a culture of contagious pedagogy,
* defend time



Impact Evaluation
-----------------

In business we _measure_.
Business define success criteria/targets and then work backwards.
How do we know it has impact? - The measuring is key.

Describe: _Agile Development_, _Ticket Sizing_, _Retrospectives_


Impact -> Justification -> Plan -> Deliver -> Evaluate

Thomas Guskeys five levels for evaluating CPD
* Participants Reaction
* Participants Learning
* Organization and Support
* Participants use of knowledge/skills
* Student learning outcomes
    * (Start here and work backwards) 'Backwards by design'
* Group input on impact

### Effective CPD
* Collaboration (nobody is an island)
    * -> from expert advisor/mentor (Who has influenced you?)
    * A network of support
* Relevant to learners (your needs are different from other teachers)
    * differentiation -> personalized


* [The Classroom Experiment (Ep.1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J25d9aC1GZA)
    * Comments
        * Jay S
            * > I had the misfortune to have to sit through a 2 day lecture of his, insisted upon by my employer.
            One thing I have learned during my 17 years in education is avoid Death by Power Point, and that is exactly what this guy did. I lost count of the amount of slides we went through. The college I work at sat 120 of us in front of him.  Never in my career have I seen someone actually nod off during a training lecture, but a guy at a table nearby did exactly that.
            * > He lost people's attention within 30 minutes.
            * > I've no doubt this man is highly intelligent and well respected but his presentation methods that day were awful. If I had done what he done in front of Estyn inspectors I'd have got my department sanctioned and I'd have been in front of HR.

            * CPD Evaluation Criteria
                1. Intent
                    1. The intended impact of the [training / CPD / programme] is clear
                    2. The [training / CPD / programme] aims to develop participants’ beliefs, knowledge, understanding and/or teaching practice
                    3. Support is given to participants and/or their schools to identify CPD requirements, support implementation and monitor and evaluate the impact of CPD in their own contexts
                2. Design
                    1. The [training / CPD / programme] design and content is underpinned by robust evidence and expertise
                    2. [training / CPD / programme] design takes into account the prior knowledge, experiences and needs of participants and/or their school contexts
                    3. CPD activities are deliberately designed to facilitate sustained changes to practice - activities may include opportunities for application, practice, reflection, collaboration and expert challenge
                3. Delivery
                    1. Effective processes are in place to ensure the [training / CPD / programme] is delivered to a high standard
                    2. Internal and external evaluation processes are used to review impact and inform ongoing improvements to the [training / CPD / programme]
                    3. Consideration is given to addressing broader factors that may impede the effectiveness of the [training / CPD / programme] - participant experience; value for money; staff time



### Ongoing

Importance of networking throughout your career.
You need to be proactive in seeking this out.

* Consistent coaching (Leverage observations)
    * With time allocated to do this (you should be doing this as part of NQT)
    * Invite another teacher (from another subject) into your classroom
* Wider community
    * Mobile App - [TeacherTapp](https://teachertapp.co.uk/)
        * Ask questions, See results, Access ongoing CPD
    * Read 1 teaching blog post a week?
* Pair (regularly with colleagues/mentor)
    * (Pair Programming - sounds like madness, it's enlightening!)
    * Pair planning (15min a week)
        * Pay attention to the learning that you are planning for pupils and the formative assessment you can use to evaluate the learning.
        * It’s helpful to be able to try out this lesson and then get together to reflect and discuss how it went.
    * Pair marking (15min a week)
        * Particularly more experienced ones!
        * Mark some work together and identify what it tells you about student learning
        * You can then discuss the most appropriate teaching strategies for the subsequent lessons
* Strategies
    * Improving pupils outcomes is not just focusing on _in lesson_ teaching strategies
    * Discuss with colleagues How to reduce marking and improve quality of feedback
