[A discussion on assessment by members of the Rethinking Assessment group](https://my.chartered.college/2020/11/webinar-rethinking-assessment/)

High stakes
Does not reflect a young persons future capacity



Lord Baker - National curriculum
1950 - 7% went on to FE - 93% left
2020 - 93% on to fe - 7% leave
Why bother showing 93% of certificates - abolish GCSE's - progrss8 and EBAC and harms broard and balanced curriculum - cultural subject dropped
Other countries don't have serious exams 16
Why has it taken so long to identify GCSE are not working?
Technical colleges 40% troubled pupils are doing well
The fire in the flit is not visible unless struck

Adolescent brain + mental health - 18 years research
MRI studies show - 25years - substantial change
Creativity is highest in adolescence
75% of all mental illness manifest before 18
Adolescent mental health prevalence increased significantly in last decade
Progressive linear assessment may be a cause
(really? but we have always had assessment?)
Neuroplasticity is heightened in adolescence
Vulnerability (mental health) and Opportunity (creativity)


?? Rachel
Exam system is disadvantaging pupils
1/3 of all youngsters fail gcse
disadvantages >1/2 fail
lower attendance rate - due to infection, malnutrition, moving more frequently, more time caring for siblings/elderly
Teacher assessment can include bias
Stress

Peter Hyman - co director of big education
School 21 (stratford - east london)
2:1 from a rustle group is no longer appropriate for the skills they are looking for
Not suiting employers, not suiting individuals
Why is it a competition? (1/3 fail?)
Assessment a purpose of education need to be aligned
Schools need to be recognised for what they offer beyond exam results

Geoff Barton
"For my 1/3fail is to give the other 2/3pass a meaning" dignitiy
I am more than just a grade
