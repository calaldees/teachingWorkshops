    * we qualitatively analyzed think-aloud interview videos of 22 high school students individually comprehending a given text-based Arduino program while interacting with its corresponding functional physical artifact 
        * 1. How do novices comprehend the given text-based Arduino program? 
        * 2. What role does the physical artifact play in program comprehension?
    * We found that novices mostly approached the program bottom-up, initially comprehending structural and later functional aspects, along different granularities. 
    * The artifact provided two distinct modes of engagement, active and interactive, that supported the program's structural and functional comprehension. However, behavioral comprehension i.e. understanding program execution leading to the observed outcome was inaccessible to many. 
    * Our findings extend program comprehension literature in two ways: 
        * (a) it provides one of the very few accounts of high school students' code comprehension in a physical computing context, and, 
        * (b) it highlights the mediating role of physical artifacts in program comprehension. 
    * Further, they point directions for future pedagogical and tool designs within physical computing to better support students' distributed program comprehension.
    * > . For the most part, the abstract run-time program behavior i.e. comprehending data and control flow was inaccessible to the novices
    * the invisible abstract program behavior was hard to comprehend. This points to a need to explicitly support novices in computing classes to understand run-time program behavior. Guiding students to understand program dynamics at appropriate levels of abstractions, also called #notional-machines
    * Their limited success with reasoning program behavior calls for explicit integration of #notional-machines within programming education
