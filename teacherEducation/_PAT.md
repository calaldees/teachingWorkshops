Garets PAT notes

Here's what I'm going to be talking through in terms of discussion points with the Meet Your Pat session:
 
PAT Session
- At the uni you have a whole host of people to help you if you need it. It's up to you to reach out and ask for help - never feel afraid or embaressed. You might not think you need help right now, and this sounds a bit useless, but trust me, there is a high chance that you will need some level of support during your time as a student. Academic or otherwise.

- Module team (ML / UI)
-- Course director
--- PAT
---- Wider Student Services

Talk through the different layers and why the student(s) might wish to engage with different people at different times through their time at CCCU.

What happens if they have no idea who to talk to? Talk to anyone, and be put in touch with the right people.

We will do all we can to help, we will try and be proactive but things aren't always obvious as we're only human, this is a 2-way street. We can only help you through your degree if you engage with us as well.

All else fails? Ask the i-zone.
