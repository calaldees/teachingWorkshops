Education Inspection Framework (EIF)
==============================

(Async 45min + 30min breakout groups + 15min whole class == 1hour30min)


ITT Core Content Framework

> 1.1. Teachers have the ability to affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of their pupils.

> 1.2. Teachers are key role models, who can influence the attitudes, values and behaviours of their pupils.

* I always refer my students to the assessment criteria. You are teachers. I will refer you to your _assessment criteria_. What criteria are schools inspected under?

TASK:
* Async Read + Consider questions below (45min)
    * [Ofsted: Inspections and performance of education providers](https://www.gov.uk/education/inspections-and-performance-of-education-providers)
        * [EIF](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/education-inspection-framework)
        * [School inspection handbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif)
            * Take note of interesting paragraph numbers to facilitate the discussion below
* Consider the following questions to discuss as a group (30min)
    1. What will inspectors consider when making judgements?
        * Subject specific criteria?
        * Other criteria? What are these other criteria and what evidence are they looking for?
    2. (Simply to spark discussion) What percentage or weighing of an Ofsted inspection could be subject-related/other-criteria-related/outside-of-your-control?
        * Your group will need to report your % or weightings and rational for the choice
    3. What actions could you and your department take to facilitate a successful Ofsted inspection?
        * Your group will compare your list with the other group - did you have something they missed? or vice versa?
        * (I hope you will take these as action points for your future work in schools)
* Whole class discussion (15min)


My Notes
========

* [Ofsted: Inspections and performance of education providers](https://www.gov.uk/education/inspections-and-performance-of-education-providers)
    * [EIF](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/education-inspection-framework)
        * > The EIF is built around the idea of the connectedness of curriculum
        * > the curriculum extends beyond the academic, technical or vocational
        * > the curriculum and the provider’s wider work support learners to develop their character – including their resilience, confidence and independence – and help them know how to keep physically and mentally healthy
    * [School inspection handbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif)
        * 178. inspectors will consider the extent to which schools are equipping pupils with the knowledge and _cultural capital_ they need to succeed in life
        * 193. Inspectors will not use schools’ internal assessment data as evidence
        * 209. Inspectors will hold discussions with pupils and staff to gather evidence about school culture and practice in relation to pupils’ behaviour, support for staff and other systems.
        * 216. The curriculum provided by schools should extend beyond the academic, technical or vocational. Schools support pupils to develop in many diverse aspects of life.
        * 218. 
            * developing responsible, respectful and active citizens who are able to play their part and become actively involved in public life as adults
            * deepening pupils’ understanding of the fundamental British values of democracy, individual liberty, the rule of law and mutual respect and tolerance
            * promoting equality of opportunity 
            * developing pupils’ character,
        * 226.
            * Inspectors will use a range of evidence to evaluate personal development, including:
                * the range, quality and take-up of extra-curricular activities offered by the school
                * how curriculum subjects such as citizenship, RE, and other areas such as personal, social, health and economic education, and relationship and sex education, contribute to pupils’ personal development
                * how well leaders promote British values through the curriculum, assemblies, wider opportunities, visits, discussions and literature
                * how well leaders develop pupils’ character through the education that they provide
                * where appropriate, the quality of debate and discussions that pupils have
                * pupils’ understanding of the protected characteristics86and how equality and diversity are promoted
                * the quality of careers information, education, advice and guidance, and how well it benefits pupils in choosing and deciding on their next steps.
