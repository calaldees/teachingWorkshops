TODO: Merge with `general/accessibility.md`

As teachers we will create digital content and put this on VLE's (Virtual Learning Environments).
We need to adhere to government requirements

### Online Content

TASK: (5min) Skim read 
* [Understanding Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - WCAG 2.1](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag)
    * Further Reading
        * [Understanding accessibility requirements for public sector bodies](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps)
            * not need to fix
                * pre-recorded audio and video published before 23 September 2020
                * live audio and video
        * [Imperial College - Video guidelines](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/staff/tools-and-reference/web-guide/policies-and-guidance/accessibility-standards/teaching-videos/)
* TASK: (10min) As a group
    * relay anything that we as teachers need to consider about the content we provide to students?

<details>
<summary>My notes</summary>

* provide transcripts for audio and video
* provide captions for video
* keyboard users
* can disable animations
* not use 'images' of text
* Don't distinguish things by colour alone

These are apparently enforceable?

### Text

* Paragraphs and dense text
    * I struggle with lots of words
    * Young people struggle with lots of words
    * Use less words
        * I break writing up into bullet-points
* [How to write in plain English](http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/how-to-write-in-plain-english.html)
    * [HemingwayApp: Web based plain english assistant](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)
        * When presenting remove redundant words. "So", "Basically", "Just" (See my blog post on presenting)

TASK: Copy/Paste some text you have written (maybe one of your reflections?) into hemingwayapp.com
