* Read this book preview (10min)
When reading; make notes about action points that would affect the planning of your computing lessons.

Many of the topics touched on in the reading will be explored in more detail in the session.

TASK: From our reading - Discuss
1. How do we Learn?
2. How will this affect planning our computing lessons?


### My Notes

* Chapter 1 - Communication Breakdown Between Science and Practice in Education
    * Research == good - our intuition is often wrong
    * Old thinking should be challenged
* Chapter 2 - Different Types of Evidence in Education
    * Behavioural psychology, cognitive psychology and neuroscience are experimental disciplines
    * Blogs, books + other - should be consumed critically
* Chapter 3 - Is Intuition the Enemy of Teaching and Learning?
    * Reading easy - so must be working
    * Retrieval feels harder - so must not as effective
* Chapter 4 - Pervasive Misunderstandings about Learning: How They Arise, and What Can We Do?
    * Many myths - learning styles
    * Shaming people is not a effective way to change minds
* Chapter 5 - Perception
    * Curse of knowledge
* Chapter 6 - Attention
    * Attention is a limited resource
    * Avoid overload
    * Selective focus - switching tasks slow
    * Mind wondering can miss vital information
* Chapter 7 - Memory
    * Not like computer - use == reconstructing == strengthen
    * Not objective - imagination can become memories
    * Short term memory == 30 seconds
    * Once encoded - we rapidly start to forget
* Chapter 8 - Strategies
    * Spacing (interleaving)
    * Elaboration
    * Concrete (real) examples
    * Visuals (dual coding)
    * Retrieval
* Chapter 9 Planning learning
    * Spacing is hard to stick to schedule
* Chapter 10 Developing understanding
    * Elaborate (add features to memory) - 'How' 'Why'
    * Must be connected to pre-existing knowledge
    * Multiple concrete (real) examples
    * Dual coding - images + words
* Chapter 11 Reinforcing learning
    * Act of retrieval strengthens memory
    * Frequent low stakes quizzes
    * Any retrieval practice is good (it feels hard)
    * Avoid 'feel good' learning
