Recap and Consolidation (2 hours)
=======================

* Intro (10min)
* Async (1 hour) Build a mind map
* Sync (30min) Discussion of the map
* Knowledge bases and collaboration tools (20min)

* You are now beginning to build your own experiences of teaching Computing in schools (all be it limited by remote teaching)
* I am interested in using technology to build a mini group knowledge base
* It would be useful for us to experience this to judge if this is a pedagogical tool you could utilise in school
* It will also give me the ability to analyses the learning and experiences you have had so far.

Group Collaborative Mind Map (1 hour)
-------------------------------------
Async

There are a range of online mind map tools.
I've decided to experiment with `coggle.it` as the interface and output looks beautiful

* Apologies: Sadly you need to sign in with a federated provider to collaborate - I will send an email to your university account


Knowledge bases and collaboration tools (20min)
---------------------------------------

* Using tools to create long standing group artefacts
* Empowering collaborative artifact creation to aid learning


### Personal Knowledge Base


* Knowledge is not linear and organised
* Rather than organising information in restrictive linear files and folders - we can have a non linear tagging and linking system

* Web
    * Wiki's - requires central server
* Local/Repo
    * Edited locally - publishable
    * Version controlled
    * Software/Tools
        * [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) is a personal knowledge management and sharing system inspired by Roam Research, built on Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
        * [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files.

* Examples
    * [Computer-Science-Resources](https://github.com/the-akira/Computer-Science-Resources)
    * [Everything I Know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) - Another knowledge base (that's awesome)

My rough knowledge base
* [github.com/ComputingTeachers/mapOfComputing](https://github.com/ComputingTeachers/mapOfComputing)


### Collaborative Knowledge Base

Class's using a wiki to build knowledge throughout a course
* Encourage them to post code snippets
    * Different ways of solving a problem 
* Links to useful resources
* Let them use the knowledge base for low-stake tests/starters (if they use it, then they will improve it)
* Publicly visible is empowering - other people could see it - it has a use

* Examples
    * [WikiBooks: A-level Computing/AQA 2015 spec](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A-level_Computing/AQA)

* Tooling
    * Adding should be frictionless and live (consider accessible tooling?)
        * [repl.it/@calaldees/mapOfComputing](https://repl.it/@calaldees/mapOfComputing) ?

* GitHub repo?
    * Collaborate with others in Markdown
    * Upon push to `main` a new site is deployed
    * [ComputingTeachers](https://github.com/ComputingTeachers) GitHub group - setup by me and some previous pgce/sd students


### Resource list
Here is a list of mine
* [hackmd.io/teachingResources/links.md](https://hackmd.io/TxywBvj9Ty6EBtL4u8S2Fw)
What tools could we use to allow other computing teachers to collaborate on this list?

Again - in summary - How do we leverage these collaborative tools in a classroom
