        * Blended Instruction
            * Live lectures must be removed - pre recorded delivery
                * Absent students have a fair shot
                * Slower students can repeat segments - take breaks when needed ADHD
                * Subtitles can be generated (equality vision or hearing issues or translated to other language)
                * Videos should have an individual point (lectures tend to ramble)
                    * 6min or less
                    * Speak quickly (watchers can pause and rewind)
                    * Don't over edit
                    * Make each chunk/video reusable (don't include temporal/class specific things)
                    * Show you as a real person (not just a voice) show your face
                    * Videos should have summary note description
                * Easy for substitute teachers
        * Self-Paced Structures
        * Mastery based grading
            * They either can or cant. No grades.
            * Focus us on the learning and not the grades
            * Each Task: Not started - in progress - complete (mastered)
    * Students are different and learn at different rates
    * Mastery marking
* > Because I don't spend my time doing lectures, I'm constantly talking with my class and marking
