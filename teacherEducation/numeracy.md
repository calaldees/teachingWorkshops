Numeracy
========

(30min lecture)

[National Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-framework-for-key-stages-1-to-4/the-national-curriculum-in-england-framework-for-key-stages-1-to-4)

> 5.1 Teachers should use every relevant subject to develop pupils’ mathematical fluency. Confidence in numeracy and other mathematical skills is a precondition of success across the national curriculum

> 5.2 Teachers should develop pupils’ numeracy and mathematical reasoning in all subjects so that they understand and appreciate the importance of mathematics....

Numeracy allows us to understand the world

Computers are just giant calculators. Numeracy is the underpinning of our entire discipline.

### Concepts/Language examples

* Compound interest
* Exponentially
    * [Will A Piece Of Paper, Folded 42 Times, Reach The Moon?](http://wwvv.codersrevolution.com/blog/will-a-piece-of-paper-folded-42-times-reach-the-moon)
* Logarithmic scales
    * (sound db) 10db is not twice as loud as 5db
* [Inverse square law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law)
* Rolling average

### Numbers to understand the world
* [Vegans in the UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_by_country#United_Kingdom)
    * 600,000 people in the UK are vegan
    * This means little without knowing the population of the UK
* A tree is 50% water. What % mass of a tree comes from the soil?
    * 1% - the other 49% is carbon from the air
* > The report says 8.2% of people aged 16-64 - some 3.4 million people in total - had never had a paid job.
    * [Resolution Foundation: Never-ever](https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2020/01/Never-ever.pdf) 2020
* What are the biggest killers of young people in the UK?
    * [health-profile-for-england-2018](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-profile-for-england-2018/chapter-2-trends-in-mortality)
* The discipline of [data-visualisation](https://github.com/ComputingTeachers/mapOfComputing/blob/main/computing/data-visualisation.md)
    * [idea.org.uk: Data Visualization Online lesson 10min](https://idea.org.uk/badge/data-visualisation)
        * Napoleon map
        * pre-attentive visual attributes
            * Length, width, orientation, size, enclosure, color intensity, color hue, curvature, shape, spatial grouping, 2d position
    * [xkcd Visualisations](http://www.vislives.com/2011/10/xkcd-visualizations.html)
    * [Information Is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/)
        * [TED-Ed: The beauty of data visualization - David McCandless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zg-C8AAIGg)
            * For data to mean something, it must have context (relative)
    * Physical visualisation
        * [Example of how many earths can fit in the sun](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/9g5fio/example_of_how_many_earths_can_fit_in_the_sun/?st=JM4IZ1M6&sh=56c0264e)

### The bias in numbers
* Correlation is not the same as causation
    * [Piracy on the high seas Vs Global temperature](https://channels.theinnovationenterprise.com/articles/hilarious-graphs-and-pirates-prove-that-correlation-is-not-causation)
    * [Why drink is the secret to humanity’s success](https://www.ft.com/content/c5ce0834-9a64-11e8-9702-5946bae86e6d)
        * Drinker live longer!? It's actually social connections

### Computing unit of work activity suggestion?
* Conduct active research in school?
* How Surveys are done - how extrapolated
* Take a survey in school.
    * Deliberately select students at random ensuring a spread of year group, gender
    * Extrapolate this to numbers of pupils
* Could create a webform with SQL database
    * (this will immediately get spammed) discussion point.
* Legal requirements of data capture? Ethical? Discussion point

### Numeracy in Computing - AI (The most powerful use of data)

* Most of the general public are totally clueless about what AI (the publicly understood term) actually is.
* AI's are neural networks statistics based.
* They are a set of weighted mathematical rules generated by a training dataset

* [A.I. Experiments: Visualizing High-Dimensional Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvsE8jm1GzE) 3min
    * Visual example of how computers take multidimensional data
* [Coding Challenge #158: Shape Classifier Neural Network with ml5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MqJzMvHE3E)
    * Could be a possible class activity - I will investigate further
* [MarI/O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44)
    * A neural network that learned to play mario world
        * created a fitness function + mutations

#### Ethical considerations of what data we train them with
* If we are using AI to train a medical system, what if our training dataset is just white males?
* [Hanna Fry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rzhpf1Ai7Z4) Explanation of AI on society

### Numeracy and Citizenship

* Hate Crimes
    * [Transgender hate crimes recorded by police go up 81%](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48756370)
        * Over what time period?
        * In comparison to what?
            * [transgender population figures](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/transgenderpopulationfigures)
                * > ONS do not produce estimates of the number of transgender people living in the UK
            * [Hate Crime Statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hate-crime-statistics)
        * What is the population of the uk?

#### Questions

These could be discussion points

* What statistics in school research could be misused and misinterpreted
    * As humans (teacher and students alike) we need to _heavily scrutinise statistics_. (Especially _Education Research_)
* What activities in computing can we make numeracy explicit?
* How could we convey to students the context/power their numeracy might have in the future
