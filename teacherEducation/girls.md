Girls in Computing
==================

* [Gender Balance in Computing](https://teachcomputing.org/gender-balance) - Help us find the best ways to encourage young women to study Computer Science
    * > The Gender Balance in Computing (GBIC) research programme is an amazing opportunity to find out what works to encourage girls to develop an interest during their primary and secondary school years, and increase the number of young women who choose to study Computer Science at GCSE and A level.
    * Six different research interventions ,Run across four years, In over 1000 state schools in England

    * Grades+subjects at school can predict the gender 69% of the time
    * Sex differences in academic achievement and school attitudes are:
        * Found internationally
        * Strong enough to correctly predict the sex of 2/3 of teenagers
        * Larger in more egalitarian countries (exactly the opposite of what feminist theory predicts)
            * The more freedom/participation of women in the workforce, the greater the identifiable gender
            * > the reasons why don't matter as much as that the feminists are wrong when they say that more sexist cultures produce larger sex differences and that diffs will disappear when women have more freedom. [](https://twitter.com/Russwarne/status/1533916316234461184)

> Here's a thing and apropos of nothing at all... 
> 2019 (most recent data set I could get before Covid madness set in) 
> Students taking Computer Science and Computing Level 3 qualifications (According to DfE) 10,429.  
> My gut feeling is that DfE is only counting A level (doesn't say that explicitly) and there's probably another 10,000 students doing BTEC and Tech levels and whatnot in Computing at level 3.
> 20,000 (ish) people total. 
> Students applying via UCAS for Computing group qualifications 136,070 (according to UCAS). 
> 15.9% female 
> So where do  the other 116,000 applicants come from?

    * > Concerns about this under representation have sparked a wealth of educational efforts to promote girls’ participation in computing, but these programs have demonstrated limited impact on reversing current trends. This paper argues that this is, in part, because these programs tend to take a narrow view of their purpose, ignoring important factors that shape girls’ identities and education/career choices – not least broader narratives around gender, race, and sexuality.
