Keystage 5 - A-Level Computing
==============================

* Objective
    * Understand the structure of the current KS5 syllabus
    * Have the toolkit to develop appropriate class activities that are targeted to the examboard specification.
        * Practical
        * Theory


How is KS5 different?
---------------------

* The good
    * You're not teaching class's of 30 - you're teaching class's of 12
    * The students largely like and understand your subject
    * You have much more contact time with them
* The bad
    * You really need good subject knowledge


Your Subject Knowledge
---------------------

* You wont be able to get 100% on an A-Level paper. I can't.
* A-Level is the first year of an undergrad degree (All university's teach the content all over again)
* Reassurance: Your Computing skills ARE sufficient for 90% of all your professional interactions.
* You CAN do this job.
* What you need is the right professional approach.
* The students need to know you that you can read/learn/grow.
* If you pretend to know it all, you will fall. Students will outpace you.

Discussion:
* Teachers are not expected/required to sit the GCSE's and A-Level exams each year along with their students.
* Would this be important requirement? would this ongoing feedback be valuable?
* Why is a teacher taking exams not common ongoing practice?
* On an application for teacher training, why is passing the GCSE in May/June-Session not a requirement?

Proposal for future years. This uni registering a center to enter candidates for GCSE and A-Level.


Time
----

* A-Levels take 360 guided learning hours per subject over the duration of the course (normally two years)
    * 180 guided learning hours a year
    * 4 to 5 hours a week contact? (over 36 weeks)
    * A single A-Level year-group is 25% of a teachers full-time timetable
        * With both 12 and 13 that is 50% of a timetable


AQA Module Weight
-----------------

Always be clear about the weight of each module. Check the spec.

* AS == 29% of A-Level grade
    * 14% Paper 1 - Practical Assessment
    * 14% Paper 2 - Theory
* A2 == 71% of A-Level grade
    * 28% Paper 1 - Practical Assessment
    * 28% Paper 2 - Theory
    * 15% Non-exam assessment - Project/Investigation
        * Any topic - Individual to student
        * 8% Technical solution
        * 7% Documentation



History of the A-Level
----------------------

* Pre 2000 - Overlap between ICT and Computing as a single subject
* 2000-ish
    * A-Level ICT (aka Office Management Studies) was split into a separate subject
    * 50% AS - 50% A2
    * AS used to be really easy (because could not rely on any previous learning in the curriculum)
    * A2 Practical project (30% of A2 -> 15% of A-Level) - was utterly ridiculous difficulty - the jump was too great
        * Beginning of AS - knowing nothing -> end of A2 program complete GUI system for user.
        * Most students failed this
    * Most students concentrated on 100% theory papers
* 2008-ish
    * First nationwide AS _practical exam_ supporting _multiple languages_ (AQA)
* 2016 - Spring clean
    * 29% AS - 71% A2
    * AS *and* A2 Practical Exam (AQA)
    * A2 Project dramatically reduced/simplified practical (14% of A-Level) + allowed research/experiments rather than _complete user products_


A-Level Courses
---------------

Academic continuation of GCSE.

* Exam boards

* TASK: (15min)
    * Open AQA and OCR specs
    * Play "Stop the difference" in the subject content - what topics are different between the two courses


* Live by the spec. Play spec bingo each lesson. Student ownership and awareness.
* Give spec to students printed (4 to a page + Duplex)
    * AQA
        * AS=30pages -> 4 sheets A4 or A2=60pages -> 8 sheets of A4

* [AQA/OCR Comparison](https://www.aqa.org.uk/resources/computer-science-and-it/as-and-a-level/computer-science-7516-7517/plan/aqa-or-ocr)
    * AQA is explicitly clear what is in the spec - practical exam is genuine application
    * OCR Coursework mostly writeup, Spec theory is vague, little practical, difficult to engage students, resources locked behind login (inaccessible to students)


Vocational Level 3 Courses (30 min)
--------------------------

* Combinations of module configurations for different needs
* Lots of specs that combine the modules in different ways
* Modules are assessed in a variety of ways - exam, coursework (internal), timed practical (long form)
* Practical focus
* Lots of time/expertise/resources required - only financially viable to colleges?

Task: (5 min)

    * > "break the line, change the sign" (operation)
* A* pathfinding


AS practical exam questions (45 min)
---------------------------

* A-Level exams require programming fluency.
* Your students will be put under serious pressure to perform in intense time periods. They will need to focus for 2.5h
* You will need to provide suitable timed mock experiences for them.


* Are you at AS level standard?
    * Create a a new [repl.it](https://repl.it/) or have your own IDE ready in a language that you are familiar with
        * Have a `Hello World` program compiling and running
        * Have a Word(?) document ready to paste in your code and a screenshot
    * Set a timer for the duration - Take a deep breath - look at the question below

The algorithm, represented using pseudo-code in Figure 4, describes a method to 
calculate the additive or multiplicative persistence of a two-digit integer. The 
examples below illustrate how additive and multiplicative persistence are
calculated.
Example: calculating the additive persistence of 87
8 + 7 = 15
1 + 5 = 6
After 2 steps the method results in a one digit answer so the additive 
persistence of 87 is 2.
Example: calculating the multiplicative persistence of 39
3 * 9 = 27
2 * 7 = 14
1 * 4 = 4
After 3 steps the method results in a one digit answer so the multiplicative 
persistence of 39 is 3.

OUTPUT "Enter integer (0-99): " 
INPUT Value 
OUTPUT "Calculate additive or multiplicative persistence (a or m)? " 
INPUT Operation 
Count  0 
WHILE Value > 9 
 IF Operation = "a" THEN 
 Value  (Value DIV 10) + (Value MOD 10) 
 ELSE 
 Value  (Value DIV 10) * (Value MOD 10) 
 ENDIF 
 Count  Count + 1 
ENDWHILE 
OUTPUT "The persistence is: " 
OUTPUT Count

One method that can be used to compress text data is run length encoding 
(RLE). When RLE is used the compressed data can be represented as a set of 
character/frequency pairs. When the same character appears in consecutive 
locations in the original text it is replaced in the compressed text by a single 
instance of the character followed by a number indicating the number of 
consecutive instances of that character. Single instances of a character are 
represented by the character followed by the number 1.
Figure 9 and Figure 10 show examples of how text would be compressed using 
this method.
Figure 9
Original text: AAARRRRGGGHH
Compressed text: A 3 R 4 G 3 H 2
Figure 10
Original text: CUTLASSES
Compressed text: C 1 U 1 T 1 L 1 A 1 S 2 E 1 S 1 
What you need to do
Task 1
Write a program that will perform the compression process described above. 
The program should display a suitable prompt asking the user to input the text to 
compress and then output the compressed text.
Task 2
Test the program works by entering the text AAARRRRGGGHH.
Task 3
Test the program works by entering the text A.

AS Specimen Paper (1 hour)
-----------------

* AQA Paper 1 is  practical programming exam
* Students are given a _Pre Release_ program 3 months before the exam
* You and your students will become familiar with the code and hypothesise on possible new features and bugfix's that might be requested in the exam
* Your students will expect you to construct a mock exam for them
* This Async task will attempt to simulate this process

TASK:
1. Read the _preliminary material_ description - Understand the problem (like knowledge about the training board setup) (10min)
2. Run Monster - get a feel for what it does (5 min)
3. Look at code (10 min)
    * identify variable conventions, top level state, objects?
4. What could they ask in an exam? Think of 3 mock exam questions you could set your students ... (15 min)
    1. Define 1 theory/observation exam question
    2. Define 1 easy request for the students to modify the code
    3. Define 1 hard request to modify the code (probably adding a new feature)
5. Read the actual exam question
    * Please don't read this before you have had a chance to come up with your own questions - I'm trying to simulate in a very compressed time-frame, what you might be required to do when teaching this course

6. Extension (try to answer the real question)
    * This is to give you a feel for the time pressure the students might feel at this point

Some consider the quality of the code written by the exam-board is weak - however ...
* The exam-board need to keep the same structure/principles across multiple languages so the questions can be consistent
* The code quality of the code that professional programmers work with throughout their career is often of poor quality
    * Good programmers can work-with/understand/improve bad code

Practical Techniques
--------------------

* Debugging (show them how to use a debugger)
    * Breakpoints - step line at a time - watch variables
    * ```python
        # at point of debugging
        breakpoint()
      ```
* Automated tests - Write the tests first!
    * Python has [doctests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html)
        * Great for marking - [separate test file](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#simple-usage-checking-examples-in-a-text-file)
        * ```python
            # At end of python file
            import doctest; doctest.testmod()
            # run with extra debug output with `python3 FILE.py -v`
          ```
        * ```bash
            python -m doctest -v MY_FILE.py
            python -m doctest -v example.txt
          ```
* Version Control
    * Get the whole class to have all their code publicly visible
        * repl.it's? github?
    * This is so important for
        * Enhancing Collaboration
        * You can always see their progress
            * You have an audit trail of work

Summary
-------

* There are multitude of KS5 offerings
    * Different A-Level boards with different assessment mechanisms
        * Practical exams can be logistically hard to implement
* A-Level take a huge amount of teacher time and expertise. They are expensive to run.
* If you don't make KS3 and KS4 fun an enjoyable, and local colleges offer amazing practical courses, then your A-Level intake will be lower and your school may decide that your KS5 offering is not financially viable
    * You must nurture a love for computing in KS3 and KS4 to get the joy of A-level
* A-Level is feels like _real_ hardcore computer science
    * The majority of secondary school teaching jobs require/focus on KS3 and KS4 because there are _orders of magnitude_ more students



* Discuss possible concerns for teaching A-Level
* Identify action points

Questions for exam board speaker
--------------------------------

Some ideas ...
 - What exam board support is available for you?
 - Some students will struggle to think of a project - Suggest 3 possible year 13 projects (verify these with the guest speaker)?
 - Are there any topics in the spec that you would struggle with - what are they? How do they compare with the knowledge areas of the rest of the group? What topics are weaker nationally?
 - How do you think the mode of study will be different from KS4 - What will the transition look like? Is there any advice for this?

* There are some calls to redefine (or even scrap) GCSE assessment at 16? To what extent have OCR been involved in the conversations and what are some of the planned alternatives? How will this affect our role as teachers
* Do you have numbers of how many entries for OCR A-Level computing and how they compare to number of entries of other exam boards
    * the GCSE numbers would also be interesting (from what I've read OCR is the dominant board)
        * GCSE OCR- 53037 AQA- 10150 Edexcel- 4667 
* With the introduction of GCSE computing, it is expected that more students have exposure and high level of computing skill. What has happened to A-Level intake and attainment?
    * Higher? More people?
* How do you see the specification changing in future years?
* How do you see the assessment changing in future years? remain paper only?
* There are some other new A-Level Computing exam boards appearing cambridgeinternational and eduqas. Do you think there is a place for so many exam boards? why do you think these have been created?
* Since education _until 18_ has been compulsory and GCSE computing is required in state schools- how have the numbers for computing level 3 courses risen? have they shifted numbers between A-Level/Vocational?
* Do many schools offer the Vocational route?

* Vocational
    *  Computing? - pass/fail?
    *  500,000 (half million) tallest to shortest - coursework based?

9,500 OCR A-Level computing entries - 60,000 uni places

Spiders web of influences on the spec
Camberage approach to assessment
    What is asessment? Huge area of research
    Design principles
OCR has largest ed-reasearch team in europe
Yellis - CATS - eaten

Regulation of seen live paper - cant do CPD

3 levels of support
Up to subject advisor

Network meetings
jcq - general regulations -> instuctions for conducting coursework

For coursework based courses don't you have to declare the support given to each student?

Active results - software
Exam builder - software
