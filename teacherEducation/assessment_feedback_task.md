Feedback Task (1 hour)
-------------

* We've heard about
    * Formative assessment helping the student move on and grow
    * FeedForward (rather than feedback)

* With the extracts of students work provided 
    * (I know this is a slighting different domain to your classrooms, however; students still need to justify their choices and articulate their ideas - e.g. Computers and society, ethics, eSafty, security, impact of AI)
* THIS IS RIDICULOUSLY HARD! Prepare to be overwhelmed by the complexity of the task I'm about to set.
1. (20min) In teams of two or three - Attempt to construct "Marking criteria" for the piece - this will be used by you (teacher) and students to peer assess work
    * Creating clear criteria is hard
2. (10min) Give your "Marking Criteria" to another group - they will mark/grade a piece based on your criteria
    * Using another persons criteria is hard
3. (20min) In pairs - What written feedback would you give to one of these candidates? (you can do more than one, but one is going to be hard enough)
    * Remember 'FeedForward'
    * Creating meaningful, actionable feedback is hard
