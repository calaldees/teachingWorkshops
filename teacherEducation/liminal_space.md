    * > These conceptual gateways are integrative, exposing the previously hidden interrelatedness of ideas, and are irreversible.
      > However they frequently present troublesome knowledge and are often points at which students become stuck.
      > Difficulty in understanding may leave the learner in a 'liminal' state of transition, a 'betwixt and between' space of knowing and not knowing, where understanding can approximate to a form of mimicry.
      > Learners navigating such spaces report a sense of uncertainty, ambiguity, paradox, anxiety, even chaos
* Forgetting is normal - Liminal space is normal - reassure them it is normal
* Don't rush to students to 'make it right' let them grapple with the problem

* Example
    * Threshold concepts
        * If statements
        * For loops
        * Variables
        * Functions and parameters
    * Once we understand those threshold concepts, we can move on to Algorithms
    * Once we understand there are different algorithms to solve the same problem we can can deliberate which may be the most appropriate and why

TASK: Build a tree of knowledge for computing, what are some of the threshold concept that unlock other skills?
