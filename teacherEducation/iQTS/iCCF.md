This is probably the inaccessible document ever made.
Dear DfE, please can you number the learn how points. That would save muchos effort for everyone. Thank you.
Also - providing 5000 words of direction and then saying "this is not a curriculum" is strange. To deliver something of this complexity I need to travel down the list and attempt to cover each one in an attempt to assume completeness.

## High Expectations (Standard 1 – ‘Set high expectations’)

### Learn that
1. Teachers have the ability to affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of their pupils.
2. Teachers are key role models, who can influence the attitudes, values and behaviours of their pupils.
3. Teacher expectations can affect pupil outcomes; setting goals that challenge and stretch pupils is essential.
4. Setting clear expectations can help communicate shared values that improve classroom and school culture.
5. A culture of mutual trust and respect supports effective relationships.
6. High-quality teaching has a long-term positive effect on pupils’ life chances, particularly for children from disadvantaged backgrounds

### Learn how to
1. Communicate a belief in the academic potential of all pupils, by:
    1. Receiving clear, consistent and effective mentoring in how to set tasks that stretch pupils, but which are achievable, within a challenging curriculum.
2. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Using intentional and consistent language that promotes challenge and aspiration.
    2. Creating a positive environment where making mistakes and learning from them and the need for effort and perseverance are part of the daily routine.
    3. Seeking opportunities to engage parents and carers in the education of their children (e.g. proactively highlighting successes) with support from expert colleagues to understand how this engagement changes depending on the age and development stage of the pupil.
3. Demonstrate consistently high behavioural expectations, by:
    1. Receiving clear, consistent and effective mentoring in how to create a culture of respect and trust in the classroom that supports all pupils to succeed (e.g. by modelling the types of courteous behaviour expected of pupils).
4. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Teaching and rigorously maintaining clear behavioural expectations (e.g. for contributions, volume level and concentration).
    2. Applying rules, sanctions and rewards in line with school policy, escalating behaviour incidents as appropriate.
    3. Acknowledging and praising pupil effort and emphasising progress being made.


## How Pupils Learn (Standard 2 – ‘Promote good progress’)

### Learn that
1. Learning involves a lasting change in pupils’ capabilities or understanding.
2. Prior knowledge plays an important role in how pupils learn; committing some key facts to their long-term memory is likely to help pupils learn more complex ideas.
3. An important factor in learning is memory, which can be thought of as comprising two elements: working memory and long-term memory.
4. Working memory is where information that is being actively processed is held, but its capacity is limited and can be overloaded.
5. Long-term memory can be considered as a store of knowledge that changes as pupils learn by integrating new ideas with existing knowledge.
6. Where prior knowledge is weak, pupils are more likely to develop misconceptions, particularly if new ideas are introduced too quickly.

### Learn how to
1. Avoid overloading working memory, by:
    1. Receiving clear, consistent and effective mentoring in how to take into account pupils’ prior knowledge when planning how much new information to introduce.
    2. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to reduce distractions that take attention away from what is being taught (e.g. keeping the complexity of a task to a minimum, so that attention is focused on the content).
2. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Breaking complex material into smaller steps (e.g. using partially completed examples to focus pupils on the specific steps).
3. Build on pupils’ prior knowledge, by:
    1. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to sequence lessons so that pupils secure foundational knowledge before encountering more complex content.
    2. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to identify possible misconceptions and plan how to prevent these forming.
4. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Encouraging pupils to share emerging understanding and points of confusion so that misconceptions can be addressed.
    2. Linking what pupils already know to what is being taught (e.g. explaining how new content builds on what is already known).
5. Increase likelihood of material being retained, by:
    1. Observing how expert colleagues plan regular review and practice of key ideas and concepts over time (e.g. through carefully planned use of structured talk activities) and deconstructing this approach.
    2. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to design practice, generation and retrieval tasks that provide just enough support so that pupils experience a high success rate when attempting challenging work.
6. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Balancing exposition, repetition, practice and retrieval of critical knowledge and skills.
    2. Increasing challenge with practice and retrieval as knowledge becomes more secure (e.g. by removing scaffolding, lengthening spacing or introducing interacting elements).


## Subject and Curriculum (Standard 3 – ‘Demonstrate good subject and curriculum knowledge’)

### Learn that
1. A school’s curriculum enables it to set out its vision for the knowledge, skills and values that its pupils will learn, encompassing the national curriculum within a coherent wider vision for successful learning.
2. Secure subject knowledge helps teachers to motivate pupils and teach effectively.
3. Ensuring pupils master foundational concepts and knowledge before moving on is likely to build pupils’ confidence and help them succeed.
4. Anticipating common misconceptions within particular subjects is also an important aspect of curricular knowledge; working closely with colleagues to develop an understanding of likely misconceptions is valuable.
5. Explicitly teaching pupils the knowledge and skills they need to succeed within particular subject areas is beneficial.
6. In order for pupils to think critically, they must have a secure understanding of knowledge within the subject area they are being asked to 
think critically about.
1. In all subject areas, pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (or “schemata”); carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important.
2. Pupils are likely to struggle to transfer what has been learnt in one discipline to a new or unfamiliar context.
3. To access the curriculum, early literacy provides fundamental knowledge; reading comprises two elements: word reading and language comprehension; systematic synthetic phonics is the most effective approach for teaching pupils to decode

### Learn how to
1. Deliver a carefully sequenced and coherent curriculum, by:
    1. Receiving clear, consistent and effective mentoring in how to identify essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the subject.
    2. Observing how expert colleagues ensure pupils’ thinking is focused on key ideas within the subject and deconstructing this approach.
    3. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues the rationale for curriculum choices, the process for arriving at current curriculum choices and how the school’s curriculum materials inform lesson preparation.
2. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Providing opportunity for all pupils to learn and master essential concepts, knowledge, skills and principles of the subject.
    2. Working with expert colleagues to accumulate and refine a collection of powerful analogies, illustrations, examples, explanations and demonstrations.
    3. Using resources and materials aligned with the school curriculum (e.g. textbooks or shared resources designed by expert colleagues that carefully sequence content).
    4. Being aware of common misconceptions and discussing with expert colleagues how to help pupils master important concepts.
3. Support pupils to build increasingly complex mental models, by:
    1. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to revisit the big ideas of the subject over time and teach key concepts through a range of examples.
    2. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how they balance exposition, repetition, practice of critical skills and knowledge.
4. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Drawing explicit links between new content and the core concepts and principles in the subject.
5. Develop fluency, by:
    1. Observing how expert colleagues use retrieval and spaced practice to build automatic recall of key knowledge and deconstructing this approach.
6. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Providing tasks that support pupils to learn key ideas securely (e.g. quizzing pupils so they develop fluency with times tables). 
7. Help pupils apply knowledge and skills to other contexts, by:
    1. Observing how expert colleagues interleave concrete and abstract examples, slowly withdrawing concrete examples and drawing attention to the underlying structure of problems and deconstructing this approach.
8. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at
    1. Ensuring pupils have relevant domain-specific knowledge, especially when being asked to think critically within a subject.
9. Develop pupils’ literacy, by:
    1. Observing how expert colleagues demonstrate a clear understanding of systematic synthetic phonics, particularly if teaching early reading and spelling, and deconstructing this approach.
    2. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to support younger pupils to become fluent readers and to write fluently and legibly.
    3. Receiving clear, consistent and effective mentoring in how to model reading comprehension by asking questions, making predictions, and summarising when reading.
    4. Receiving clear, consistent and effective mentoring in how to promote reading for pleasure (e.g. by using a range of whole class reading approaches and regularly reading high-quality texts to children).
    5. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to teach different forms of writing by modelling planning, drafting and editing.
10. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Teaching unfamiliar vocabulary explicitly and planning for pupils to be repeatedly exposed to high-utility and high-frequency vocabulary in what is taught.
    2. Modelling and requiring high-quality oral language, recognising that spoken language underpins the development of reading and writing (e.g. requiring pupils to respond to questions in full sentences, making use of relevant technical vocabulary).


## Classroom Practice (Standard 4 – ‘Plan and teach well structured lessons’)

### Learn that
1. Effective teaching can transform pupils’ knowledge, capabilities and beliefs about learning.
2. Effective teachers introduce new material in steps, explicitly linking new ideas to what has been previously studied and learned.
3. Modelling helps pupils understand new processes and ideas; good models make abstract ideas concrete and accessible.
4. Guides, scaffolds and worked examples can help pupils apply new ideas, but should be gradually removed as pupil expertise increases.
5. Explicitly teaching pupils metacognitive strategies linked to subject knowledge, including how to plan, monitor and evaluate, supports independence and academic success.
6. Questioning is an essential tool for teachers; questions can be used for many purposes, including to check pupils’ prior knowledge, assess understanding and break down problems.
7. High-quality classroom talk can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary.
8. Practice is an integral part of effective teaching; ensuring pupils have repeated opportunities to practise, with appropriate guidance and support, increases success.
9. Paired and group activities can increase pupil success, but to work together effectively pupils need guidance, support and practice.
10. How pupils are grouped is also important; care should be taken to monitor the impact of groupings on pupil attainment, behaviour and motivation.
11. Homework can improve pupil outcomes, particularly for older pupils, but it is likely that the quality of homework and its relevance to main class teaching is more important than the amount set.

### Learn how to
1. Plan effective lessons, by:
    1. Observing how expert colleagues break tasks down into constituent components when first setting up independent practice (e.g. using tasks that scaffold pupils through meta-cognitive and procedural processes) and deconstructing this approach.
2. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Using modelling, explanations and scaffolds, acknowledging that novices need more structure early in a domain.
    2. Enabling critical thinking and problem solving by first teaching the necessary foundational content knowledge.
    3. Removing scaffolding only when pupils are achieving a high degree of success in applying previously taught material.
    4. Providing sufficient opportunity for pupils to consolidate and practise applying new knowledge and skills.
3. Make good use of expositions, by:
    1. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to use concrete representation of abstract ideas (e.g. making use of analogies, metaphors, examples and non-examples).
4. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Starting expositions at the point of current pupil understanding.
    2. Combining a verbal explanation with a relevant graphical representation of the same concept or process, where appropriate.
5. Model effectively, by:
    1. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to make the steps in a process memorable and ensuring pupils can recall them (e.g. naming them, developing mnemonics, or linking to memorable stories).
6. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Narrating thought processes when modelling to make explicit how experts think (e.g. asking questions aloud that pupils should consider when working independently and drawing pupils’ attention to links with prior knowledge).
    2. Exposing potential pitfalls and explaining how to avoid them. Stimulate pupil thinking and check for understanding, by:
7. Stimulate pupil thinking and check for understanding, by:
    1. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to consider the factors that will support effective collaborative or paired work (e.g. familiarity with routines, whether pupils have the necessary prior knowledge and how pupils are grouped).
    2. Receiving clear, consistent and effective mentoring in how to provide scaffolds for pupil talk to increase the focus and rigour of dialogue.
8. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Planning activities around what you want pupils to think hard about.
    2. Including a range of types of questions in class discussions to extend and challenge pupils (e.g. by modelling new vocabulary or asking pupils to justify answers).
    3. Providing appropriate wait time between question and response where more developed responses are required.


## Adaptive Teaching (Standard 5 – ‘Adapt teaching’)

### Learn that
1. Pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed.
2. Seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, is an essential part of teaching.
3. Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success.
4. Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils.
5. Flexibly grouping pupils within a class to provide more tailored support can be effective but care should be taken to monitor its impact on engagement and motivation, particularly for low attaining pupils.
6. There is a common misconception that pupils have distinct and identifiable learning styles. This is not supported by evidence and attempting to tailor lessons to learning styles is unlikely to be beneficial.
7. Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential.

### Learn how to
1. Develop an understanding of different pupil needs, by:
    1. Receiving clear, consistent and effective mentoring in supporting pupils with a range of additional needs, including how to use the SEND Code of Practice, which provides additional guidance on supporting pupils with SEND effectively.

3. Provide opportunity for all pupils to experience success, by:
    1. Observing how expert colleagues adapt lessons, whilst maintaining high expectations for all, so that all pupils have the opportunity to meet expectations and deconstructing this approach.
    2. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to balance input of new content so that pupils master important concepts
4. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Making effective use of teaching assistants and other adults in the classroom under supervision of expert colleagues
5. Meet individual needs without creating unnecessary workload, by:
    1. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how they decide whether intervening within lessons with individuals and small groups would be more efficient and effective than planning different lessons for different groups of pupils.
6. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Making use of well-designed resources (e.g. textbooks).
    2. Planning to connect new content with pupils' existing knowledge or providing additional pre-teaching if pupils lack critical knowledge
    3. Building in additional practice or removing unnecessary expositions.
    4. Reframing questions to provide greater scaffolding or greater stretch.
7. Group pupils effectively, by:
    1. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how the placement school changes groups regularly, avoiding the perception that groups are fixed.
    2. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how the placement school ensures that any groups based on attainment are subject specific.
8. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Applying high expectations to all groups, and ensuring all pupils have access to a rich curriculum.


## Assessment (Standard 6 – ‘Make accurate and productive use of assessment’)

### Learn That
1. Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and needs.
2. Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear.
3. Before using any assessment, teachers should be clear about the decision it will be used to support and be able to justify its use.
4. To be of value, teachers use information from assessments to inform the decisions they make; in turn, pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect.
5. High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve.
6. Over time, feedback should support pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning.
7. Working with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to assessment is important assessment can become onerous and have a disproportionate impact on workload.

### Learn How
1. Avoid common assessment pitfalls, by:
    1. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to plan formative assessment tasks linked to lesson objectives and think ahead about what would indicate understanding (e.g. by using hinge questions to pinpoint knowledge gaps).
    2. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to choose, where possible, externally validated materials, used in controlled conditions when required to make summative assessments.
2. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Drawing conclusions about what pupils have learned by looking at patterns of performance over a number of assessments with support and scaffolding from expert colleagues (e.g. appreciating that assessments draw inferences about learning from performance).
3. Check prior knowledge and understanding during lessons, by:
    1. Receiving clear, consistent and effective mentoring in how to structure tasks and questions to enable the identification of knowledge gaps and misconceptions (e.g. by using common misconceptions within multiple-choice questions).

    1. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how pupils’ responses to feedback can vary depending on a range of social factors (e.g. the message the feedback contains or the age of the child).
    2. Receiving clear, consistent and effective mentoring in how to scaffold self-assessment by sharing model work with pupils, highlighting key details.
    3. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to ensure feedback is specific and helpful when using peer- or selfassessment.
6. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Focusing on specific actions for pupils and providing time for pupils to respond to feedback.
7. Make marking manageable and effective, by:
    1. Receiving clear, consistent and effective mentoring in how to record data only when it is useful for improving pupil outcomes.
    2. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues to develop an understanding that written marking is only one form of feedback.
    3. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to identify efficient approaches to marking and alternative approaches to providing feedback (e.g. using whole class feedback or well supported peer- and self-assessment) and deconstructing this approach.
8. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Using verbal feedback during lessons in place of written feedback after lessons where possible.
    2. Reducing the opportunity cost of marking (e.g. by using abbreviations and codes in written feedback).
    3. Prioritising the highlighting of errors related to misunderstandings, rather than careless mistakes when marking


## Managing Behaviour (Standard 7 – ‘Manage behaviour effectively’)

### Learn that
1. Establishing and reinforcing routines, including through positive reinforcement, can help create an effective learning environment.
2. A predictable and secure environment benefits all pupils, but is particularly valuable for pupils with special educational needs.
3. The ability to self-regulate one’s emotions affects pupils’ ability to learn, success in school and future lives.
4. Teachers can influence pupils’ resilience and beliefs about their ability to succeed, by ensuring all pupils have the opportunity to experience meaningful success.
5. Building effective relationships is easier when pupils believe that their feelings will be considered and understood.
6. Pupils are motivated by intrinsic factors (related to their identity and values) and extrinsic factors (related to reward).
7. Pupils’ investment in learning is also driven by their prior experiences and perceptions of success and failure.

### Learn how to
1. Develop a positive, predictable and safe environment for pupils, by:
    1. Receiving clear, consistent and effective mentoring in how to respond quickly to any behaviour or bullying that threatens emotional safety.
2. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Establishing a supportive and inclusive environment with a predictable system of reward and sanction in the classroom.
    2. Working alongside colleagues as part of a wider system of behaviour management (e.g. recognising responsibilities and understanding the right to assistance and training from senior colleagues).
    3. Giving manageable, specific and sequential instructions.
    4. Checking pupils’ understanding of instructions before a task begins.
    5. Using consistent language and non-verbal signals for common classroom directions.
    6. Using early and least-intrusive interventions as an initial response to low level disruption.
3. Establish effective routines and expectations, by:
    1. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how routines are established at the beginning of the school year, both in classrooms and around the school
4. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Creating and explicitly teaching routines in line with the school ethos that maximise time for learning (e.g. setting and reinforcing expectations about key transition points).
    2. Reinforcing established school and classroom routines
5. Build trusting relationships, by:
    1. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues effective strategies for liaising with parents, carers and colleagues to better understand pupils’ individual circumstances and how they can be supported to meet high academic and behavioural expectations.
6. And - following expert input - by taking opportunities to practise, receive feedback and improve at:
    1. Responding consistently to pupil behaviour.
    2. Engaging parents, carers and colleagues with support (e.g. discussing a script) from expert colleagues and mentors both in formal and informal settings.
7. Motivate pupils, by:
    1. Observing how expert colleagues support pupils to master challenging content, which builds towards long-term goals and deconstructing this approach
    2. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how experienced colleagues provide opportunities for pupils to articulate their long term goals and helping them to see how these are related to their success in school.
    3. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to support pupils to journey from needing extrinsic motivation to being motivated to work intrinsically.


## Professional Behaviours (Standard 8 – ‘Fulfil wider professional responsibilities’)

### Learn that
1. Effective professional development is likely to be sustained over time, involve expert support or coaching and opportunities for collaboration.
2. Reflective practice, supported by feedback from and observation of experienced colleagues, professional debate, and learning from educational research, is also likely to support improvement.
3. Teachers can make valuable contributions to the wider life of the school in a broad range of ways, including by supporting and developing effective professional relationships with colleagues.
4. Building effective relationships with parents, carers and families can improve pupils’ motivation, behaviour and academic success.
5. Teaching assistants (TAs) can support pupils more effectively when they are prepared for lessons by teachers, and when TAs supplement rather than replace support from teachers.
6. SENCOs, pastoral leaders, careers advisors and other specialist colleagues also have valuable expertise and can ensure that appropriate support is in place for pupils.
7. Engaging in high-quality professional development can help teachers improve.
