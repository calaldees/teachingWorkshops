* How 

* Update mentor weekley foci to match subject curriculum
* Students use the readings!!! Make them subject specific - put them in weekley SP sessions (should have) - GIVE THEM A READING!!
    * Essesntial reading + suggested reading

* Give MENTORS something before a mentor session to facilitate discussion - 10min reading in the session (short ones? abstracts?)
    * raise a red flag for mentors that are not interested in research

Every lesson ending
* Action points (in ePortfolio)
* Spotlight questions Bingo!
