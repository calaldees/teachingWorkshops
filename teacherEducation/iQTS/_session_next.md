Nyree Primary?


* Features of high quality teaching
    * Not lecturing
    * Joint plan - make it better - make it better
* "The Curriculum" is the university AND the placement
* School Curriculum vs Our Curriculum 
    * (not good) only work with one provider
* SSL Reps listen to feedback - close the feedback loop
* ePortfolio
    * ePortfolio === Students Responsibility
        * Targeted Support Plan about professionalism if not up to date
        * 1 hour timetabled?
    * Targets === mentors responsibility
        * Targets -> action (name a class?)
* Edit mentor foci to "revisit earlier targets" around contrasting placement and placement 2
    * KS5: How assess? how include? how stretch?
* Cool/little-used resource See resources on AllDocuments->PupilProgressBundle->SQmappedtoTS
* Absence data not available
* Suggest 'possible targets' in subject sessions
    * and 'how/actions are you going to get there'
    * End of session 'Action points' in weekley meeting template
    * 'Menu of Targets'
        * Early targets are VERY different from solo teaching at the end of the course
* John-Paul
    * Video pedagogy

* How 

* Update mentor weekley foci to match subject curriculum
* Students use the readings!!! Make them subject specific - put them in weekley SP sessions (should have) - GIVE THEM A READING!!
    * Essesntial reading + suggested reading

* Give MENTORS something before a mentor session to facilitate discussion - 10min reading in the session (short ones? abstracts?)
    * raise a red flag for mentors that are not interested in research

Every lesson ending
* Action points (in ePortfolio)
* Spotlight questions Bingo!
