    * All class response systems

            > Prompting pupils to elaborate when responding to questioning to check that a correct answer stems from secure understanding.
            > Monitoring pupil work during lessons, including checking for misconceptions
        * iCCF Learn How
            * >  Drawing conclusions about what pupils have learned by looking at patterns of performance over a number of assessments with support and scaffolding from expert colleagues (e.g. appreciating that assessments draw inferences about learning from performance).
    * FeedBack -> FeedForward
    * Activate learners as participants
        * > Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to ensure feedback is specific and helpful when using peer- or self assessment.
    * Unless the: Do it, Say it, Write it - it never happened
    * Unless feedback leads to learner/student action - it's useless
        * [[assessment_example]]

        * Possible strategy? - students MUST respond/action-plan/acknowledge feedback
* Diagnostic questions
    * iCCF Learn How
        * >  Receiving clear, consistent and effective mentoring in how to structure tasks and questions to enable the identification of knowledge gaps and misconceptions (e.g. by using common misconceptions within multiple-choice questions).

Secondary – Supporting Literacy  

iCCF - Learn that: 

1. To access the curriculum, early literacy provides fundamental knowledge; reading comprises two elements: word reading and language comprehension; systematic synthetic phonics is the most effective approach for teaching pupils to decode.  

2.  Every teacher can improve pupils’ literacy, including by explicitly teaching reading, writing and oral language skills specific to individual disciplines. 


### pre
How did you learn to read? Reflect on the process and also consider if you have children in your class who find this more challenging
