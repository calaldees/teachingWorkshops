Secondary – Supporting Literacy  

iCCF - Learn that: 

1. To access the curriculum, early literacy provides fundamental knowledge; reading comprises two elements: word reading and language comprehension; systematic synthetic phonics is the most effective approach for teaching pupils to decode.  

2.  Every teacher can improve pupils’ literacy, including by explicitly teaching reading, writing and oral language skills specific to individual disciplines. 


### pre
How did you learn to read? Reflect on the process and also consider if you have children in your class who find this more challenging
