Introductions
-------------
### Who am I?

My background
* 7 years teaching ICT and Computing in secondary schools - Practical battle experience
* 10 years as a senior developer in central London across a range of domains
* (2 years sessions) + 2 year formally as Lecturer in Education. (You are my 5th cohort)
* I will be constantly upskilling this for the rest of my career

I have my own ideas about how to teach computing
* Multiple languages at once
* Freedom (self direct-ish)/project based/Creativity (removal of hierarchy)
* Unit tests, Pair programming (talking about code and collaborating), Version control
But this course is not about my _opinions_ or about my preferred teaching methods.
You must develop your own critically to develop your own subject pedagogy knowledge.
