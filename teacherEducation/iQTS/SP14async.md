==========

* We have considered a range of pedagogical techniques over the year. Let bring some concepts together.


* The subject knowledge audit 
    * crudely levelled your skills 1 to 4:
        * 1 theory or exam question
        * 2 manifesting the knowledge in a practical way
        * 3 teaching the topic (I would argue that you would struggle to teach effectively if you cannot manifest practical skills)
        * 4 discuss advantages/disadvantages to different approaches/methods of teaching the topic

* You now have a banks of experience teaching and a range of from teaching these topics once
* We are going to reflect and consider new approaches


Reflecting on an aspect of subject pedagogy (1 hour)
-------------------------------------------

* Identify Topic/Concepts (and year group) that you feel you've struggled to teach
* Find another Computing educator
* With the Topic/Concept - Each have an opportunity to describe:
    * Your pedagogical approach
    * Why you structured it that way
    * Why students found it difficult to engage/grow
* Discuss actions and ideas for tackling this a different way

You can use some notes/bullets from this discussion as evidence for level 4 in some of your subject knowledge categories.


Next Year (1 hour)
---------

Every time we teach, we all think about "next time". Thinking about topics and ideas over the past year ...

### Micro level (topic)

| Topic | Last year | Next year | Actions (with dates) |
|-|-|-|-|
| | | | |

e.g. networks with year 10? Loops with year 7? year 11 implementing solution from a flowchart.

### Macro level (course)

| Year Group? | Last year | Next year | Actions (with dates) |
|-|-|-|-|
| | | | |

e.g. logging on with year 7? homework with year 10? explicit use of IDE/tools? clubs?

### Things to consider
* Metacognition
* Tooling (IDE's)
* Spaced repetition (spiral curriculum)
* SSDD
* Peer Assessment


Subject Knowledge Audit Additions? (30min)
--------------------------------

The subject knowledge audit is far from complete. The disciplin is huge. Many aspects are missing (especially with ICT and Digital Literacy).
Remember the audit is for Computing teachers (not students). This is for teachers to grow.

1. Think of some additions
    * Example of previous ideas
        * https://computingteachers.uk/subjectKnowledge/subject-knowledge-2022.html
            * https://github.com/ComputingTeachers/subjectKnowledge/blob/main/subject-knowledge-2023.json
2. Make a 'pull request' to add items to 2023. (You can use version control because you are a computing teacher)


Subject knowledge target(s) (30min)
------------------------

To make meaningful progress next year, it is important to strategically put things in place to develop in the right directions. If you are just left to "do your teaching" you may find yourself working hard but with little meaningful development. It is important to have longer terms targets/goals in order to carve out and plan a way to get to your goal.

It would be wise to ensure that you have one very well worded SMART target that focuses on your subject knowledge. 
This could be 
* time for a project (to develop skills in a particular area)
* an experimental after school club you want to run
* A training course you want to enrole on

Construct a SMART target and put this forward to your mentor for next year.
