* Competent people have a mental model of how to approach a common/regular task (e.g. debugging code). Competent people have constructed a model of what to do 'in advance of the problem'.
    * e.g. removing an audience from a difficult student, dropping a lesson completely to tackle a racial or sexual slur.
