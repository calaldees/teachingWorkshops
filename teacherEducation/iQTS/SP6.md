## iCCF
* Adaptive Teaching (Standard 5 – ‘Adapt teaching’)
    1. Pupils are likely to learn at different rates and to require different levels and types of support from teachers to succeed.
    2. Seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, is an essential part of teaching.
    3. Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success.
    4. Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils.
    5. Flexibly grouping pupils within a class to provide more tailored support can be effective but care should be taken to monitor its impact on engagement and motivation, particularly for low attaining pupils.
    6. There is a common misconception that pupils have distinct and identifiable learning styles. This is not supported by evidence and attempting to tailor lessons to learning styles is unlikely to be beneficial.
    7. Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential.
