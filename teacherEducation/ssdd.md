Same Surface - Different Depth
==============================

* Imagine there are no year groups in your school
* Always delivering to mixed ages
    * Topic content KS3 to KS5?
    * Assessment criteria KS3 to KS5?
    * Scafold/direct the purpose/objective of peer interactions (linked to assessment)
        * Higher -> Lower (deliberately identify and use correct terminology. "An advanced student can")
        * Lower -> Higher (systematically describe the problem and understanding up to this point)
        * peer -> peer (validation? discussion?)
* This is the holy grail - At this point you can deal with bottom set with SEND though to the most gifted engaged students.
* Separate project time? directed? goals? metacognition (time to just do it)
