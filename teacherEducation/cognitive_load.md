> Dylan Wiliam tweeted on 26 January 2017 that he had ‘come to the conclusion Sweller’s Cognitive Load Theory is the single most important thing for teachers to know

Attention is a finite resource and can be depleted quickly.

> Working memory should be seen as short term and finite, 
> whereas long-term memory can be seen as infinite. 
>
> The aim should be to move knowledge to long-term memory 
> because when a student is exposed to new material, 
> they can draw on this previous knowledge and the cognitive load is reduced.
>
> However, if subject knowledge is incomplete, 
> the student is unable to fall back on the long-term memory and the working memory becomes overloaded, 
> leading to working memory failures. 
(Gathercole and Alloway, 2007),

> Be wary of reducing cognitive load too much – the learning process should be manageable, but not overly fragmented.
See Expertise Reversal Effect in [inclusion.md](./inclusion.md) - too much support cases lack of engagement and inattention


> Gesturing is a technique children use to reduce cognitive load while speaking

Help sheets or Knowledge Organisers can help reduce cognitive load.
