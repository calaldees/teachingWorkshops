TASK: Code review criteria
What rubric/guides/guidelines/criteria could you create to help young people make meaning comments/judgment in code review?

<details>
<summary>My ideas</summary>

* Criteria for code review (can they help build the criteria?)
    * Are the variables well named? (descriptive, not to long, not to short?)
    * Does the code have a readable flow (low to high, high to low, not higledy pigeldy)
    * Are there any tests/assertions/checks/examples?
    * Do the comments help describe what is going on?
    * Resilience: Is there a way to crash/break the program?
    * Can any parts of simplified or use less lines of code?
