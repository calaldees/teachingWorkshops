Invitation
==========

Hi PGCE/SchoolDirect Secondary Computing Trainees,

I am Allan, the subject tutor for Secondary Computing at Canterbury Christ Church University.
I will be leading your subject pedagogy sessions next year.

I would like to extend the invitation for you to join me for a short online introductory session to say hello and share some information about next year's subject specific programme of study.
This session is not a formal requirement of the course but should provide some useful foundations.

PGCE Secondary Computing - Taster Session
xxxday xth August 202
12:00 to 13:00
(MSTeams Meeting link at the bottom of this email)

If you are unable to join us for this session, my session notes are available at
https://github.com/calaldees/teachingWorkshops/blob/master/teacherEducation/_introMeet.md
and
https://github.com/calaldees/teachingWorkshops/blob/master/teacherEducation/_pre_course_activities.md

I very much hope that you will be able to join me for this session so that we can start to get to know each other, and I can also share some useful pre-information with you.
I know that previous cohorts have found this introductory session very helpful in enabling them to start the programme with confidence come September.
It will give you the opportunity to ask any questions that you might have at this stage.

If you intend to attend the session, could you reply to this email or accept the calendar invitation.

If you want to contact for a one-to-one video catchup at any point before the course, you can setup an MSTeams meeting using the booking system link in my footer.

I'm looking forward to meeting you all soon.

* Subject Pedagogy: _How_ to teach Computing
    * > the method and practice of teaching, especially as an academic subject or theoretical concept
    * We will not give you
        * Resources to teach with (no lesson plans, no mark schemes)
* Reflective Practice
    * Once you have completed an activity, ask yourself the magical question: So what ...
        * what you have learned,
        * what do you now know more about
        * and how might that learning go on to influence your own future practice in the classroom?
    * You will make mistakes (continuously)
        * What matters is that everything is an opportunity to learn/grow

Course curriculum: Framed as a series of ten questions to develop your deepening understanding of learning and teaching practice over the year
1. Who are we?
2. How do we learn to teach?
3. What is a teacher?
4. What is education?
5. How do children learn?
6. What does ‘inclusion’ really mean?
7. How do you plan and assess for learning?
8. What is a broad and balanced curriculum?
9. How do I lead learning?
10. What is my impact?

Partnership schools and mentors will be using the same questions with you at the same time, to ensure joined up support between your placements and university teaching.


Support
-------

No Teacher is an island - You wont make this journey alone

* You wont have a frame of reference for what 'normal' looks like.
* You wont know what support you are entitled to, or what support you might me lacking.
* Multiple people will be looking out for your and supporting your first teaching steps.

        * Moving on from the student/university mindset
        * What is the expected behaviour of a profession?
    * _Expert Beginner_ (A huge change)
        * You are an accomplished expert and respected in a particular field
        * Teaching is a different fields
        * Changing your role/status is hard and unsettling
            * Age? You may have a mentor younger than you
* Identified formal support process (you, tutor, mentor can raise at any time)

    * You are in the drivers seat
    * There is no right/wrong mark
        * some students have the misconception of wanting their folder to be marked
    * No linear path (no spoon feed)
    * Your Portfolio is for you - You develop you
    * You drive mentor meetings
* You ARE a professional
    * If asked to teach a lesson on html - you are capable - you do - you ask for guidance if needed.
* collaborate and communicate professionally with your cohort
    * Everyone on your course does not have to be "Your friend" - you are all at different points in your lives with different attitudes and interests
    * You don't have to _like_ your colleagues or classmates - you do need to collaborate/communicate with them

* Professional identity
    * [The personal and professional selves of teachers: stable and unstable identities](https://www2.uwe.ac.uk/services/Marketing/students/NewStudents%202017%20onwards/PGCE%20Secondary%20reading%20-%20personal%20and%20professional%20selves.pdf) (C.Day et al 2005)

* Design a household routine to support you
* Consider how you will come across as a professional from day 1
    * From this day forth - your are a professional educator
    * Cloths?
    * Don't expect to be spoon fed
* [_pre_course_activities.md](_pre_course_activities.md)
    * Books, exam boards, news, tools


Questions
---------

What I can tell you:
* You will be successful if you follow all the advice given next year
* You will be well supported
* You will find a great sense of achievement over the year
* It will be _hard_ work
* The year will change you!

IMPORTANT ACTIONS
=================

Don’t forget to register and formally join the course – please keep an eye on emails for further updates on dates and timings.

Please note that as part of the enrolment procedure to the programme it is essential that all students undertake the following three activities prior to the start of the programme.

1. You must be able to show, in person, your original certificates (or official evidence) of your GCSE in English and Maths, as well as the original certificate confirming your degree. You will need to do this at the Registration event in early September 2020.
2. You must also complete successful Occupational Health clearance (PGCE and non-salaried School Direct only)
3. You must also attain clearance through the DBS process (PGCE and non- salaried School Direct only)

Please note that you are responsible for initiating both the Occupational Health Check and the DBS clearance.

It is important that you are aware now that any student who has not passed through all three checks by the end of registration day in early September 2021 will not be able to start the programme.
Your place is in jeopardy unless you achieve all three actions above by that date.

## Learning Support Plan (LSP)

You will be assessed/supported with any additional learning needs. 
This is not automatic. You need to apply for this.
