What is Education
=================

* [‘Teachers can only ever have a small impact on their students’ results - yet they are judged as if they are 100% responsible’](https://www.tes.com/magazine/archive/teachers-can-only-ever-have-small-impact-their-students-results-yet-they-are-judged-if)
    * > It’s wrong to judge teachers purely on the outcomes of their students – there’s actually very little evidence to suggest that a teacher’s performance heavily influences exam results, writes one history teacher

    * 'Training' has fallen out of favour over 'Education', but we don't object to 'Medical Training'
    * Teaching as _Unnatural_ Work - learning to do things that are not common in daily life
        * Everybody informally teaches - but skilled classroom teaching is a different concept
        * Cultivating professional working relationships is not the same as 'being good with people'
        * > To provoke discordant thinking or errors in logic and argument intentionally would seem odd if not downright irritating in many situations
        * We do not choose who we interact with
        * > Doing well at mathematics in school, for example, does not readily equip one to understand or be interested in others’ mathematical thinking or to understand ideas or solutions in multiple ways ... a de-centering of one’s own mathematical reasoning and the flexibility to see the content from another’s perspective.
    * Shifting From Knowledge to Practice
        * Teaching is improvisational - so how can we teach prescribed things? (think if how you train jazz musicians)
    * > making practice the centerpiece of teachers’ education would elevate, not dimingish, the professionalism of teaching and teacher education.
        > Conversely, a system that implies that teaching is predominantly improvisational, impossible to specify, and developed idiosyncratically through individual experience is no system at all and not at all professional.

    * We can’t identify good teachers by observing them
        * seems nonsensical, but there is now a large body of evidence
        * judges are no better than flipping a coin
        * 'distinguished' teachers students made 30 per cent more progress than teacher rated 'below basic'
        * every teacher looks better when teaching higher-achievers
    * We can’t identify good teachers from changes in test scores
        * Teachers test scores were compared against student-height. The results were similar margin of error
        * Teacher was ranked 6/100 one year, changed nothing about their teaching, next year was 96/100
        * > students taught by less experienced, less qualified instructors did better on their end-of-course examinations, and rated their instructors more positively than students taught by more qualified, more experienced instructors.
        * > However, the students taught by more experienced instructors did better on follow-on courses. The less experienced instructors were preparing students for this year’s test; the more experienced instructors were preparing students for next year’s test.
        * Action: create a culture where every teacher is expected to improve, not because they are ineffective, but because they can be even better

    * When asking teachers to change their practice, a model will almost certainly help
    * But this study also tells us:
        * Don’t worry too much about narrating the model – worry more about what it shows.
        * Don’t rely on video models to convey underlying principles – reading still matters.
        * Practice can boost self-efficacy, even if effectiveness remains stuck!

* measuring teaching - [We cant measure the quality of a teacher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ynsMwzsCsg&t=560s)
    * Difficult to measure because the feedback loop is really long - years
    * Value added may only be apparent 2 or 3 years after the teacher has stoped teaching those children
    * We don't just measure academic achievement - what about engagement and enjoyment

We need the confidence to say "we are not going to have the time to cover the desirable bites of the curriculum"

* [Define assessment terms](https://youtu.be/7ynsMwzsCsg?t=1000)
* Assessment 4 learning is not formative assessment
* responsive teaching is only the teacher bit of formative assessment
* formative assessment - good feedback works towards their own redundancy - make are students less dependent on us
