> Fellow #computing teachers what do you use for homework? We have lots of different fragmented ways across ks3 and ks4 courses in computing/business and I want to unify it with one approach. #teaching #edtech #computerscience

* [@pddring]()
    * KS3: 3 hw per half term:
        * ✅keyword game linked to current topic to improve literacy/comprehension
        * ✅careers research linked to current topic (including requests for questions to ask people in those jobs)
        * ✅revision/recap quiz linked to current topic
* The Edexcel SoW comes with homework worksheets and resources which are a great starting point.
Still working on iMedia to make hw more consistent and useful. Don't teach business.
What do you do?

* > We are going down the route of Microsoft forms quizzes with a focus on definitions terminology for this half term and then going to re-evaluate.

* > Ks4: Weekly choice of activities (between 30-60mins) out of:
✅theory worksheet (principals of CS)
✅python worksheet (computational thinking) with links to code on http://create.withcode.uk
✅code comprehension competitive challenges/support videos on

> I second the Google forms for KS3 with as many self marking elements as possible.  Blooklets and kahoots used for revision preps. KS4 is PPQ on Google docs or visual revision on canva.


> KS3 I don't do homework. I can't guarantee access to devices and software etc. Instead we try to run more clubs in the week. Attendance is good. We only see KS3 once a week its just more work. Ks4 and 5 we use @Carousel_Learn which is fantastic. Pupils love it and results are 👍
