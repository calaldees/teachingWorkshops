Political Guidance
------------------

* [Political impartiality in schools](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/political-impartiality-in-schools/political-impartiality-in-schools) 17th Feb 2022
    * These legal duties mean schools:
        * Must prohibit the promotion of partisan political views
            * a strong supporter of a party, cause, or person.
        * Should take steps to ensure the balanced presentation of opposing views on political issues when they are brought to the attention of pupils
    * Schools are also required to actively promote the fundamental British values of:
        * democracy
        * the rule of law
        * individual liberty
        * mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs
* Difficult situation
    * Simultaneously - convey political positions - while also provides wider views - but not too wide
    * We should not ignore all politics because our teaching should have community context
    * Relevant to computing is privacy and freedom of speech

Surveys

    * > Teaching about political issues, the different views people have, and the ways pupils can engage in our democratic society is an essential part of a broad and balanced curriculum. It is an important way in which schools support pupils to become active citizens who can form their own views, whilst having an understanding and respect for legitimate differences of opinion.
