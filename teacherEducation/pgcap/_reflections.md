Looking at the students reflections is a very powerful experience. I can see the impact of each sessions.
Seeing these reflections highlights how deep there thoughts and analysis are.
It is particularly impressive. This is a postgraduate level course. The students are seasoned thinkers. 
Although they are at the start of their teacher journy, these first steps of reflection are very promising.

I need to follow up some members of the group for reflections.
If they are unable to reflect clearly during this period of relative calm at uni, they may struggle when they hit placements.
I have already identified some students and may consider a personal support plan for some. It would be wise to raise this swiftly with my team.

The biggest upcoming challenge is how I engage with mentors to support the students.
Mentors visits and liaison is a new role for me.
It will be a good opportunity for me to create some powerful learning opportunities for my students.
I am a little intimidated by the experience of the mentors. They are experienced actively practising teachers and experienced mentors.
My hope is that by supporting mentors with the Christ Church documentation it will be an important linchpin in making the course feel more holistic.
I don't need to be the most experienced super tutor, I just need to support the mentors and students in joining the dots.


## 10/11/2020 C#

I have been teaching on "Introduction to C# Module for Computer Science. The course is well prescribed with a series of lectures, workshops and assessments. By the end of the course the students are expected to take a written requirements for a program and create a working solution in code.

The groups are completely mixed ability. Some have coded before. Some have never coded before. Some weaker students did not understand they need to fully secure the knowledge from each session and need to stick in additional time (if needed) to ensure they are ready for the next session. We are now at the point where students need to combine concepts. This has lead to a few of the weaker students being paralysed with how to continue.

This issue should have been identified earlier by both my self and the students. With covid it has been difficult to move around the room and see this visibly. Online assessments have been alerting them to gaps in their knowledge but the students have not actioned these knowledge gaps and I had not engaged individually with them about their marks. I see them sporadically and I feel pressured to deliver prescribed lecture material to keep the group in sync with the rest of the course.

The students were unaware of the demands of the course time allocation and lacked the skills to identify the importance of what they did not know.

They may be measuring their progress by their peers (who are also lacking in skillset). They may lack an overall understanding of the course progression.

I have managed to arrange the students seating so that I can move more freely. I have taken time out of sessions while the others are working to give individual support to fill in past topics. The students deeply appreciated the individual attention. I have reiterated the demands of university learning and the course aims and given individual topics and past workshops to complete.

In future identifying these students earlier would give them a better chance success. More time needs to be allocated for repeating the expectations of time but also repeating the expectations of expected progress for the students to self identify areas. This transition space between school and university needs more consideration from me. I will ask other colleagues teaching on this course for advice on how they identify/handle these progress issues.


### Feedback
This is a good reflection Allan, you've been really honest and presented a clear example with a very good level of specific evidence. 

To improve your reflective writing going forward I'd suggest that you 

* start the writing with the headline of the reflection which is that you need access to students' formative assessments from early on in the semester so that you can target support for those students who are struggling and ensure that those who are thriving are being stretched.
    * This will help you to reduce your narration and to free up more word count for reflection including incorporating student and peer feedback and perhaps quoting some scholarship on formative assessments. 
* Setting up check-in points on the online assessments and being open with students about how they and you can use these as opportunities to develop the skills necessary to succeeding on the module will help the students to be more self-directed in their learning and you to target support effectively and before crisis points close to summative (credit-bearing) assessments. 
* Do use the active mode and the first person voice e.g. 
    * instead of 'This transition space between school and university needs more consideration from me' 
    * make it (for example) 'I will better support students in their transition from school to university learning by teaching them to use formative assessments as an opportunity to assess and develop on their own learning and supporting them in this'. 
    * This way the 'Now what' in Borton's terms is clearly spelt out. 
* Also, before the assessment, do have those conversations with colleagues and include one or two short quotes from them e.g. one colleague said 'tell students we want to know and help when they're struggling'.
