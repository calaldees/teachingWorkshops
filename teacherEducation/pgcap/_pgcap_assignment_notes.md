This module has two Summative Assessments: 

1. Authentic Practice Recording - (30%) - 15 minutes - due before 14:00 on 3 February 2021

15-minutes of yourself facilitating learning in an authentic context with interaction from learners. Must demonstrate (i) inclusive practice, (ii) engagement of learners in active learning, and (iii) some form of effective inbuilt evaluation of practice. If you are working in a classroom setting, please record this session using Recap and submit the link to your chosen 15-minutes on the template via Turnitin. If you are teaching online, please record your session in Blackboard collaborate and submit the link to your chosen 15-minutes on the template via Turnitin.

2. Written or recorded reflection on practice - (70%) - 2,500-words  or  a 25-minute recorded oral presentation - due before 14:00 on 3 February 2021     

A critical reflection on your teaching and/or support of learning in the light of reflecting on learning from (i) microteaching (ii) a teaching observation by a peer or mentor, (iii) my authentic practice (iv) theory and/or scholarship on teaching. Please include a completed observation form in your appendix. This will not be counted in the wordcount for the assignment. Thus any direct points you wish to make about the observation must be contained within the wordcount/time of the reflection.


The length of your claim can vary by minus or plus 10%. If it is longer than 110%, the University penalty system will apply.No appendices are allowed.

* The reflection is a first-person critical narrative comprising of
    * a brief introduction in which you explain your current role and responsibilities relating in 
        * teaching and/or supporting learning in HE, 
        * its context, 
        * what specific themes of reflection you have chosen for the assignment and why
    * two or three themes of reflection of your choice provided they comply with the learning outcomes and UKPSF D1 requirements below. 
        * You may use some of the reflections that you put down in your reflective logs.
        * It should be a synoptic reflection and critical evaluation of what you have learnt about teaching practice in your own subject discipline or professional service area, 
        * and how you are developing and monitoring your own teaching and support of learners in the light of this.
    * a brief conclusion in which you 
        * summarise your achievements 
        * and address future challenges

* Level Descriptors
    * D1 - Associate Fellow
        1. Successful engagement with at least two of the five Areas of Activity
            * Your reflection must focus on at least two areas of activities, which would have been chosen in consultation with your peers, mentor and module leader. 
            * You may choose to focus on more than two areas of activity if you wish, but do ensure that two at least are critically engaged with. 
            * The choice of As will depend partly on your role, and you should refer to the UKPSF further guidance on Blackboard to help you make your choice. 
            * A3 is not really scrutinised in the IFL module, but all of the other As are potentially good choices given your role and context.
        2. Successful engagement in appropriate teaching and practices related to these Areas of Activity
            * The practices reflected on must be, amongst other things, based on your observations of authentic practices
        3. Appropriate Core Knowledge and understanding of at least K1 and K2
            * K1 and K2 must be discussed in your reflections, but other Ks can also be incorporated as your practice allows.
        4. A commitment to appropriate Professional Values in facilitating others’ learning
            * Professional Values V1, V2 and V3 are covered in the IFL module, especially the areas of inclusivity and closing the attainment gap of BAME students, and the CCCU’s widening participation key priority. It is therefore anticipated that you will engage with these in your reflections, but other dimensions relating to these agendas are also possible.
        5. Relevant professional practices, subject and pedagogic research and/or scholarship within the above activities
            * You must make use of some of the research and scholarship discussed in the module and available on the Blackboard. Other resources can also be used
        6. Successful engagement, where appropriate, in professional development activity related to teaching, learning and assessment responsibilities
            * In addition to your engagement with this module, you need to reflect on at least one other element of CPD that you have taken part of in the past year, and one that you are intending to take part in.


1. Focus of assignment (D1.i-vi)
    * Pass
        * D1 Descriptor is acknowledged and reflected upon in the work.  You show some awareness of the issues involved and discernible relationships between the descriptor and applications to your own practice. You provide conclusions but do not explicitly spell out how you've reached them.
    * Merit
        * Critical reflection on the D1 descriptor in relation to your own practice.  Some relevant issues are identified but either the range is rather narrow or issues are introduced but not explored in detail. You dealing with some of the issues raised and provide convincing conclusions which are clearly related to the objectives of the assignment.	
    * Distinction
        * Critical reflection on the D1 descriptor in relation to your own practice.  An appropriate range of relevant issues identified and distinctive approach taken in dealing with them.  Conclusions are clearly related to objectives of the assignment and the work shows some originality.
2. Evaluation of practice (D1.i-vi)
    * Pass
        * The work contains some evaluation of your practice against broadly defined criteria for effectiveness. The outcomes from your evaluation, and their implications for your future practice are discussed briefly or partially.
    * Merit
        * The work contains evaluation of your practice with clearly defined aims and criteria and the evaluation is based on evidence from at least two sources or perspectives (e.g. self-reflection; student feedback; student assessment performance; observation of teaching by another educator; external examination reports). The outcomes from your evaluation and their implications are discussed only in the context of your individual practice. 
    * Distinction
        * In the work you evaluate your practice using evidence from a range of sources and perspectives (e.g. self-reflection; student feedback; student assessment performance; observation of teaching by another educator; external examination reports). You clearly define the aims and criteria of the evaluation, and key measures indicating success. You justify these in relation to past or future challenges in your practice. You discuss the outcomes from your evaluation and their implications for your practice across multiple domains (e.g. departmental, disciplinary, institutional and/or sector-wide implications).
3. Reflection and application to your own practice (D1.ii and vi)
    * Pass
        * You share examples from your practice in the work. While they may briefly link theory and research to practice, this reflection is not sustained and/or is not explicitly focused on improving your practice.
    * Merit
        * You share relevant examples from your practice throughout the work and link them to relevant theory or research. However, this reflection on your own practice does not draw together examples to make a sustained case for improvement. 
    * Distinction
        * Throughout the work you analyse relevant, detailed and specific examples from your practice in the light of educational research and theory. This reflection on your practice provides a clear vision and basis of evidence for improving your practice.
4. 
    * Pass
        * The work engages with core readings or scholarship from the programme. It shows evidence of relevant professional practices, subject and pedagogic research and/or scholarship within the L&T activities discussed.
    * Merit
        * The work engages with research and scholarship beyond the core module readings and accurately communicates issues implicit in these sources. It shows good evidence of relevant professional practices, subject and pedagogic research and/or scholarship within the L&T activities discussed.
    * Distinction
        * The work engages with a wide range of research and scholarship, including disciplinary pedagogies or scholarly debates within educational research. It shows very good evidence of relevant professional practices, subject and pedagogic research and/or scholarship within the L&T activities discussed.
5. Quality of academic communication
    * Pass
        * The work meets at least 4 of the sub-criteria (see 'Refer' descriptor), including consistency of referencing. It meets threshold standards for academic writing at level 7. References are accurate but do not exceed the minimum or go beyond the core module readings
    * Merit
        * The work meets at least 5 of the sub-criteria (see 'Refer' descriptor) and is a good example of writing at level 7. References are accurate and exceed the minimum.
    * Distinction
        * The work meets all six sub-criteria (see 'Refer' descriptor) and is exemplary for academic writing at level 7. The references are accurate and exceed the minimum; they demonstrate significant and up-to-date breadth of literature review (including referring to some relevant scholarship within the writer's discipline).

Notes for observers:
Accessibility – were the learning materials (PowerPoint, handouts, equipment etc) and tasks able to be accessed by all students, including those with sensory or physical impairments?  Where necessary, were reasonable adjustments made?  Were recent accessibility requirements met?
Cultural environment – equal opportunity to express their views and were their views treated with respect by the tutor and peers?

Strategies to promote ‘active’ learning
students largely adopting a passive role?
opportunities for discussion, debate, experimentation, peer interaction, problem-solving, and other active learning opportunities? 
Were the learning outcomes clearly stated at the outset, and what strategies did the tutor use to assess learning during and at the end of the session?
Effective checking for learning and evaluation methods
Did the tutor design activities or checks for learning that enabled them to evaluate their students learning?
This could be by promoting active learning strategies and managing the classroom so that all students participate and thus demonstrate their learning and knowledge.
Did they use a tool that checks knowledge in such a way that all students could take part?

How was the session evaluated?
This could range from asking students if the session allowed them to meet the learning outcomes and what they need in the next session (though the checking of learning should largely inform this too), to more formal use of evaluation feedback forms.
How are students being given a voice?

Remote only - little context for them


--

Your reflections are excellent.
You've clearly engaged with the subject content and have a superb attitude to challenging your own thinking with clearly actionable points.

You made a comment "I am going to make a crap teacher"
That is not true.
I have taught some SHOCKINGLY bad lessons and made many professional blunders, but I was highly reflective and grew with the support of my friends and colleagues over many years.

You are doing the right thing with ensuring you sustainably and incrementally improve your subject knowledge. Ensure that your python work is tracked on your subject knowledge tracker.

I think some of your dates of your reflections needs to be corrected.

Your attitude is mature and determined.
Keep up the good work!

I think your school placement is going to be a very transformative experience for you.

One other question- can you confirm that for the lit review exercise your expectation is that we limit the books/papers/articles to 2 or 3?


There is no 'limit'.

My suggestion was that your argument will probably centre around the points made in 2 or 3 of them.

You will probably have to draw (in a cursory manner) from more. (Maybe between 6 to 10).
It depends on the sources.
10 Books that are all 300 pages each is different from 10 journals that are 5min read each.

You want the reader of your essay to think "This student has explored this topic sufficiently to have an informed opinion"

Hi xx,

> i am really struggling to understand anything. 

Quite a bit to unpack there.

"Understand anything" is very vague.

A core skill you need to develop is identifying/articulating your issue in more detail.
For me, or anyone, (or even yourself) to take the next step, you need to try to describe where you are and what you want to do.

If I was going to answer that question in a blasé way I could just point you at
The C# books on the reading list for the module
https://learn.canterbury.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_2440750_1&course_id=_13357_1&mode=reset
That would not be effective.

The module you are taking require a certain degree of study skills and self efficacy.


> what can i do to improve my knowledge.

Let's see if I can give you some pointers.

1.) Ask a directed question.

Go back though the lessons and workshops for the C# module and find something that you understand.
I know you can create a "Hello World" program and run it from workshop 1. There is a start.
Go though each of the workshop tasks from the very first one in order.
When you come across something you you don't understand, attempt the problem with the best of your ability.

Start an email
Maybe take a screenshot? or copy and paste the complete code into an email.
Say:
"I am trying to x y z"
"I have re-read the lecture slides and tried the examples and I still don't have the answer."
"I think I get x, so I did this ... I don't know how it fits into y. I have no idea what z is and how it relates to x and y"
"I tried searching for y online and found these three links but I didnt undertsn tham and I dont think they are related. I also looked in the course ebook for example. I found the chapter on y, but nothing fits my problem"
(You may find you don't need to send the email because you found the answer yourself)

If I can see, what you trying to attempt, what you tried to do and what you don't understand, I can help you.

Self efficacy is your ability to resolve the issue yourself using the resources you have available.

All the workshop tasks set each week will build the skills to do this.
If you can do 100% of the workshop tasks you will pass the exam.
Go back and systematically nail every single one of those tasks.
Even if you only get through 5 weeks of the 12 week course by the end of module, you will still be able to get some marks in the exam. 5 workshops of understanding is better than 0 workshops of understanding.

If you think that would take too long; you are on a full time course and you have 200 hours allocated to the module.
At university teachers will not prescribe your every task. You need to decide how to use your time.
Your objective is to pass each module.

This leads onto ...

2.) Consider improving your time management
The university know this is 'jump' for some new students and have provided support.
https://blogs.canterbury.ac.uk/ccculearningskills/year-0-1/time-management/
I don't know your home background but you might try and activity where you total up the number of hours spend playing computer games. If you were to half that number of hours and invest that in the foundation programming skills. That is a good investment in time. You are going to reuse those skills throughout your degree.

3.) Do you have a "Personal Academic Tutor"?
https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/current-students/support-services/personal-support/personal-academic-tutor
It might be worth asking for one. They might be able to help do something similar to what I am attempting to do for you now.

They might be able to help you build study skills.


Given how limited my time is, I hope this email points you in the right diction and prompts you to think further about your study skills.

I am happy to answer a directed question.

Now; go kick some code's ass!


Allan

Anonymous student feedback
--------------------------

On 3 dates throughout the term I solicited anonymous feedback from my teacher trainers. These were collected via online forms.

> The topics and views of everyone were taken in to consideration and the use of a the shared Google Doc form which was edited in real-time was a good way of collaborating.

The PGCE students did not start their placements until the end of November. This increased tensions and stress.

> Without being in a school placement much of the course is very difficult to connect with, which for me at least severely hampers the ability to remember the topics.

Recruit?
--------



I feel under pressure to recruit for my course. I have 9 trainees for PGCE/SchoolDirect Computing. This is not currently a financially viable course of the university. We need high quality Computing teachers. All of my trainees receive a £26,000 bursary as Computing is a shortage subject (DfE Initial teacher training bursaries 2020).

### Introduction to C# - Group differentiation

I have been teaching on "Introduction to C#" Module for Computer Science. The course is well prescribed with a series of lectures, workshops and assessments. By the end of the course the students are expected to take a written requirements for a program and create a working solution in code.

The groups are completely mixed ability. Some have coded before. Some have never coded before. Some weaker students did not understand they need to fully secure the knowledge from each session and need to stick in additional time (if needed) to ensure they are ready for the next session. We are now at the point where students need to combine concepts. This has lead to a few of the weaker students being paralysed with how to continue.

This issue should have been identified earlier by both my self and the students. With covid it has been difficult to move around the room and see this visibly. Online assessments have been alerting them to gaps in their knowledge but the students have not actioned these knowledge gaps and I had not engaged individually with them about their marks. I see them sporadically and I feel pressured to deliver prescribed lecture material to keep the group in sync with the rest of the course.

The students were unaware of the demands of the course time allocation and lacked the skills to identify the importance of what they did not know.

They may be measuring their progress by their peers (who are also lacking in skill-set). They may lack an overall understanding of the course progression.

I have managed to arrange the students seating so that I can move more freely. I have taken time out of sessions while the others are working to give individual support to fill in past topics. The students deeply appreciated the individual attention. I have reiterated the demands of university learning and the course aims and given individual topics and past workshops to complete.

In future identifying these students earlier would give them a better chance success. More time needs to be allocated for repeating the expectations of time but also repeating the expectations of expected progress for the students to self identify areas. I will better support students in their transition from school to university learning by teaching them to use formative assessments as an opportunity to assess and develop on their own learning and supporting them in this. I will ask other colleagues teaching on this course for advice on how they identify/handle these progress issues.

> I think groups should be 3+ which would really help convey ideas and give multiple points of view which can then be sifted and key points brought back to the group.

> Overall I am really enjoying the Friday sessions; personally I don't have much to be critical of at this moment in time.

> There needs to be more content to address the fact that us PGCE students do not have any practical experience going on outside of these Friday lessons.

> 80% of the course should be hands on experience so we are effectively only getting 20% of the knowledge we should be so it is much harder to learn from this limited view of teaching as a profession, though not for Allan's want of trying! 
> The content he delivers is good and detailed where it needs to be with plenty of time to discuss any issues the group perceive. Just all falls a bit short without the practical experience.

Accessibility - markdown

> I found it a bit hard at the beginning to navigate through your presentation because it is such a non-traditional way of visual aid

> I think the use of markdown is wrong when giving lessons. It is less engaging than pp.

I have a ADHD student. They have requested more breaks in sessions.
I have an older student that has alienated themselves for peer support network (they were kicked from WhatsApp group due to condescending/offensive comments) . Integrating them into group discussions is now much harder and I cant use pair work as most students in the group are on edge when working 1-to-1 with them.
To make progress I'm always using groups of 3+


Read reflections and show you care about the student

Support the student - look at wellbeing - identify the root causese. _Identifying_ is the majority of the battle
