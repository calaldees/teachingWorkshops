IFL - Microteach - Diagnostic Questions
---------------------------------------

### Intro

* I'm Allan
* I teach secondary school teachers how to teach
* I will demo an interesting _enhancement_ to the assessment questions you already ask
* Objective
    * Understand the concept and value of _Diagnostic Questions_

### Multiple Choice Questions

* It's common/good-practice to have digital multiple choice quiz's. [Rosenshine](https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/Rosenshine.pdf) (2012)
    * The learner actively engaging with problem/recall is more effective than passive reading/highlighting
    * Gives you (the teacher) information on topics that need further attention (inform planning)
* Can we do better than just *Correct* or *Incorrect*?
    * We can use the incorrect answers for [Formative Assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formative_assessment)

### Diagnostic Questions

Every wrong answer unveils a perceived misconception

* Example of a Diagnostic Question
    * Find the area of the shape ![Diagnostic Questions - Maths - Area of a 10cm by 7cm rectangle](./images/diagnostic_question_maths_area.svg)
        1. 17cm<sup>2</sup>
        2. 70cm<sup>2</sup>
        3. 34cm<sup>2</sup>
        4. 35cm<sup>2</sup>

    * The misconceptions
        1. 17cm<sup>2</sup> (simple addition)
        2. 70cm<sup>2</sup> (correct)
        3. 34cm<sup>2</sup> (perimeter)
        4. 35cm<sup>2</sup> (area of a triangle - multiply sides and half)

* Five Golden Rules for Diagnostic Questions
    * They should be clear and unambiguous
    * They should test a single skill or concept
    * Students should be able to answer in less than 20 seconds
        * More than this means learner is making multiple steps; hard to pin down specific misconception
    * You should learn something from each incorrect response (without the student needing to explain their process)
    * It is not possible to answer the question correctly whilst still holding a key misconception

### Task

* Part 1 (4 min)
    * (This is going to be REALLY hard)
    * Construct a diagnostic question for your specialist domain:
        * One correct answer
        * One incorrect answers (that unveils a misconception)
        * (add additional incorrect answers if you have time)
    * Type your question + possible answers into the chat
* Part 2 (4min)
    * As a group we will try to answer your question
        * We are not specialists, so we may struggle
    * You can describe to us the misconceptions you targeted

### Going further

Diagnostic questions can be the focus of further leaning via [Dialogic Teaching](http://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/programmes/dialogic/whatis.html).

Present mistakes as learning opportunities.

* Extension (to students)
    * Write the best explanation you possibly can for the correct answer
    * Convince me why each of the alternative answers is wrong
    * Can you explain what misconception someone has who chooses each of the incorrect answers?
    * What other alternative incorrect answers would you have included, and why?
    * Can you write some questions that would make each of the wrong answers correct?
    * Create your own diagnostic question
        * explaining your reasoning behind each of your three incorrect answers
* Get feedback from students as to 'why' they think that is the answer
    * Find the worst 3 answered questions
    * Find the most popular misconceptions and read explanations written by students
* As a teacher - Ask 3 questions:
    * Where do students go wrong?
    * Why do they go wrong?
    * What are we going to do about it?

### Summary

* Diagnostic questions augment our existing questioning/spaced-repetition/immediate-feedback systems
* The extra information helps us diagnose misconceptions and informs planning

I hope you find this idea useful in your teaching.
