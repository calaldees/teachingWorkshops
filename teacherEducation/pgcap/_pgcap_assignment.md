Introduction
------------

This is a first-person critical reflection to demonstrate my progress towards the UK Professional Standards Framework (UKPSF 2011). I have recently started in the role of _Lecturer in Education of Computing_ at Canterbury Christ Church University. My role is to support trainee teachers in their first year of secondary school teaching. I am responsible for designing/delivering subject pedagogy sessions and providing ongoing support to mentors that support trainees in school placements.

The concept of _teaching teachers_ is a very meta concept. The skills involved in teaching are often considered higher order skills (Bloom 1964). The skills of a teacher can be normally assessed through evidence of their classroom teaching. This term (September 2020 to December 2020) has been challenging because of the global pandemic. All teaching has been mandated to be remote. My trainees first entered their school placements on 16th November. This has restricted the normal practical learning opportunities. The remote situation has also lead to high tensions, anxiety and emotional distance.

My reflections will focus on inclusion and interactions with remote learners in the context of teacher training. Teacher training courses have a wide variety of trainee diversity. Trainees could be fresh graduate with no industry experience through to late career changers. It is well documented that career changers have differing learning needs (Bar-Tal et-al 2020, Troesch and Bauer 2017, Kimmel et al 2020, Furlong & Maynard 2012).

The focus of my reflections will be on the following professional areas of activity:
* (UKPSF-A2) Teach and/or support learning
* (UKPSF-A4) Develop effective learning environments and approaches to student support and guidance

The key measures I will be focusing on will be:
* Analysis of the effectiveness of teaching. Are students able to apply the concepts I convey.
* Do my learners feel safe and secure in their learning environment. Do they feel like they are making progress as learners.

I collected information from lesson observations, anonymous feedback forms, external organisations, professional standards documentation and scholarship. A subset of this material is reflected upon in this write-up.


Micro-teach - Diagnostic questions
----------------------------------

Micro-teaching is a 15 minuets teaching activity delivered to peers. We demonstrate our knowledge of teaching practice in a compressed timespan. I delivered an introduction to the concept of "Diagnostic Questions", a teaching technique currently under review by the Education Endowment Foundation. An "incorrect answer" to a question should unveil the students' misconception.

It was pointed out that I did not solicit any input from my session for the first 8min. Teaching requires constant attention to soliciting response and engagement, especially online. Being an online learner and being "talked at" is not an engaging experience. 

The micro-teach has challenged my thinking about the frequency I interact with my learners online. I must improve my regular explicit checking of understanding. Face-to-face I can read facial expressions and body language and feel more open to asking questions. When teaching online I need to explicitly check the understanding of my students more.

Dylan Wiliam, a professor of education specialising in formative assessment, has an interesting technique for soliciting ongoing feedback from the class with 'traffic light' coloured cups on desks. Green for "I'm ok", amber "for this is tricky" and red for "I'm lost, stop, help" (Wiliam 2011). 

The online platform Blackboard Collaborate supports a similar concept. The UI to control the feedback states are fairly hidden. Once applied the state is transient and vanishes after 30 seconds. There is no log of the state change. Maybe it is worth investing time in directing my students to become familiar with those interface options, or investigate an alternate way of soliciting ongoing feedback from online sessions.

I was surprised when some learners did not understand the concept of _Diagnostic Questions_. This was relayed to me in the chat and some of the task responses missed the concept. I was expecting masters level learners to grasp the concept quickly. Was there a baseline level of understanding that I missed? Was my explanation not clear enough? Was this an artefact of my teaching? Or the restrictions of the compressed format of microteaching?

The feedback I received from the students indicated the difficulty of understanding the concept in the compressed time frame:

> I struggled to grasp the concept within the time frame you set for the task.

> spend a bit more time at the beginning to ‘set the stage’. I was not sure what you meant by the term ‘diagnostic questions’ 

These comments alerting me to what the issue but did not help me immediately make the jump to understand _why_ this had happened or what the solution could be. One solution was 'spend more time' on the topic.

My module lead responded with the following feedback:
> from my perspective the task was ambitious in terms of Bloom's taxonomy, asking us to go straight to the highest level thinking skill with 'create' solo with a concept we'd only just been introduced to

Upon reflection I was not considering the Cognitive Load of the task I had set (Sweller, 1998, Shibli 2020) (ukpsf-k3). I was requiring students to understand the concept of diagnostic questions and additionally deeply delve into their own subject domains. I could have scaffolded the learning by asking the learners to create a diagnostic question for a known simpler domain. Maybe I could have provided a constrained Maths concept and asked pairs to create the diagnostic question.

Competent adults (however qualified) still feel vulnerable when placed in the role of the learner.

> Presenting my mistake in ‘not grasping the concept’ in the chat bar was difficult for me to feedback.

This reinforces Dylan Wiliam's observation of the importance of 'low stakes' assessment (Wiliam 2011).


Critical Incident
-----------------

I encountered a significant critical incident in my teaching practice. I have leveraged Tripp's "critical incidents in teaching cycle" to reflect on the incident (Tripp 1993).

Very early on in my teacher training group, one individual was having difficulty integrating with the course. He was an older career changer. His elitist aggressive tone aggravated and alienated his peers and created ongoing friction with me. He parted ways from the rest of his peers by leaving their informal WhatsApp support group. This behaviour was also identified by other more experienced colleges teaching other modules. His interactions culminated in an incident where others in the group were having difficulty in remote breakout sessions and facilitating group dialogue. He made the claim that he felt "unsafe" in my sessions and aggressively demanded that action should be taken immediately via email. This was difficult to marshal while delivering a live session. I called upon senior colleges to assist and support. 

One of the comments this student raised about me was that "Allan portrayed himself as a sage that had complete control of our course and this caused the group to be cautious about contributing"

> The learning community should provide a safe space for challenge and transformation
(CCCU - Learning and Teaching Strategy - 2015)

I attempted to dissect the events that lead up to this, consulting further scholarship and using Brookfield's lenses (Brookfield 1995) to consider the view from the learner's perspective.

In the opening session of the course I described my role and responsibilities:
* I liaise with mentors in their placement school
* mark the formal subject pedagogy assignments
* write student references at the end of the year
* perform the intermediary professional reviews throughout the year
* monitor engagement and contributions in subject sessions
* relay progress to other professionals as needed.
I also used the term _formative assessment_.

Through the lens of the career changer this could be perceived as a threat. I was younger than the student, I apparently had complete control. I used the scary term 'assessment' and the student was probably unaware of the terminology of 'formative assessment'. The student rightly or wrongly became defensive and aggressive in their further communication.

Wiliam, who coined the term 'formative assessment', identifies that the term is often misconstrued:
> The big mistake that Paul and I made was calling this stuff "assessment"… because when you use the word assessment, people think about tests and exams’ (Stewart, 2012). He later commented that it should probably have been called something like ‘responsive teaching’ (Wiliam, 2013b).

As highlighted by the comment a student made in my micro-teach session. Students need a 'low stakes' environment in order to feel safe in their learning. (Wiliam 2011)

The challenges career changes face when training to teach has been well documented (Bar-Tal et-al 2020, Troesch and Bauer 2017, Kimmel et al 2020, Furlong & Maynard 2012). The DfE has setup support organisations like nowteach.org.uk, 'Now Teach' provides a route for people with significant life experience to successfully become teachers and stay in the sector for the long-term. I consulted with 'Now Teach' staff while reintegrating this student into my sessions.

The way this student was communicating was not in-line with part 2 of the DfE teaching standards "personal and professional conduct". And this was addressed in the reintegration meetings.

As higher education professionals we must respect individual learners and the diverse backgrounds they may come from. Career changes have specific needs. It is important that there is opportunity for learners of all types and that their individual needs are addressed. Higher education (especially teacher training) operates in a wider societal context. We need to instil the professional values of clean, clear, unbiased communication as highlighted by DfE Teacher Standards, CCCU Learning and Teaching Strategy (ukpsf-v1-v3-v4).

Next year I will attempt to clearly convey the support and underlying principles of our higher education institution. I will try to pre-empt and alleviate the panic and fear that comes with such a demanding and daunting course. If I can clearly convey our underlying motivations and instil trust from all students at an early stage, that will lead to better teaching and learning environment (ukpsf-a4).


Authentic Practice - Diagram tooling
------------------------------------

Building upon my microteaching experience, I designed a 25min teaching activity to introduce my teacher training group to tooling that could help them create formal computer science diagram notation. A video recording of this session was submitted as part of this module. (ukpsf-a1-a2)

My session started by listing 6 types of formal Computer Science diagram notations with links to various examples. I took a poll of how many of these diagram types have they heard of. I was not asking for mastery, just an awareness. The results I got back were disheartening. Only one student had heard of them all, some said 'none' and most identified one diagram type. Many of these diagrams are used on the GCSE textbook and all of them are required for A-Level (DfE Teacher Standards; standard 3 - Demonstrate good subject and curriculum knowledge). This is a recurring pattern. I am supposed to be conveying Computing subject pedagogy but find that the group's foundations of Computing subject knowledge is a barrier to learning. (ukpsf-a3)

This experience has prompted me to allocate time and actively convey the knowledge requirements of the discipline. I have a subject knowledge audit tracker that the students use to track their knowledge throughout the year. This tracker currently does not have a section for formal diagram notation. I will audit the GCSE and A-Level course specifications and identify common themes that may need to be added to this audit tracker. At the beginning of the course I recommend students undertake a GCSE paper and work through the mark scheme. I should make this activity mandatory. This should highlight to the trainee the gaps in their subject knowledge. This formative assessment needs to be conducted in a safe 'low stakes' way. Students must not feel embarrassed by their scores or pressured. This could lead to panic and aggression (see critical incident reflection).

At the end of the session I asked if the students felt this 'Diagram Tooling' was a worthwhile skill-set. The responses were less than enthusiastic with multiple members preferring their existing skill-set of using simpler generic tools. I am an experienced practitioner that has created countless exam style questions and handouts. I find this tooling an invaluable productivity boost (ukpsf-k1). I'm passionate about these tools and hope that this passion is contagious. The CCCU; Learning and Teaching Strategy states "We encourage the development of a sense of wonder, the quest for knowledge". I want them to feel this enthusiasm for new knowledge.

Through the lens of the learners (Brookfield 1995), they don't currently see the benefits of this technique, to them it feels like an unneeded additional layer of complexity. Again this highlights to me the importance of Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller 1998, Shibli 2020). The overhead of learning the diagram notation and the added complexity of the diagram tool was too much. The session was still a success; the objective was to understand that _tooling exists_ and it served as an excellent introduction to these diagram types. As the learners become more proficient teachers, I'm sure that they will identify the long winded pattern of manually creating diagrams and be aware of the possible tools available to them.


Observation by a senior colleague
---------------------------------

As part of the IFL module and part of ongoing department QA, a senior colleague observed a remotely delivered session of mine. The 6 hour session was recoded in full. The observer was directed to a 15min segment that portrayed an average/normal practice. (ukpsf-k6)

I was praised for my "clear overview of the material", "clear time frames for the activities", "a good mix of synchronous and asynchronous work" and "inclusion of the numerous hyperlinks also takes students to further reading". The basic mechanics of teaching were solid. I was following the CCCU Policies. (ukpsf-k4)

Two comments stood out as particularly insightful

### Technology for delivery

Rather than separating my lessons into discreet slides/screens, I opt for a continuous stream that I can scroll through. This allows interactivity by allowing me to highlight words as I speak.

>  The highlighting of the text to which you are referring as you lead the session is helpful in focussing the learners on the point you are trying to make. Just a point worth noting however is when it is used too much during your talk, it can be distracting, especially if it jumps around quite a lot.

I must be mindful that consistent fast movements screen-shared online are fatiguing and stressful for the learners.

### Challenging student comments

> The students mention that the primary curriculum offers "mucking about and tinkering"; I am sure that this wasn’t meant offensively, but I just wonder how our primary colleagues would feel about their curriculum being described in this way. Sometime we do need to counter what the students say – even if it isn’t meant how it sounds – just to make the point

With the aggression and friction I have had from some of my students, I have become more passive with challenging them on passing issues. From the CCCU Learning and Teaching Strategy "The learning community should provide a safe space for challenge and transformation". I need to consider strategies for challenging student comments. (ukpsf-a4)


Conclusion
----------

This formal reflection assignment has positively supported my growth as a higher education professional. The UK Professional Standards have helped focus my reflections and enabled me to access a wider range of material to improve my practice. 

I set out to investigate student emotional engagement with my sessions. Two themes emerged: 
1. Even advanced adult learners need careful consideration of cognitive load in order for them to feel confident and comfortable with their progress
2. Students from diverse backgrounds need different types of support to help them feel emotionally settled

There are clear actions that I can start preparing for next year's trainees:
1. The first session and first impressions have important ramifications
2. Consider closer attention to assessing students prior subject knowledge and take that into account when taking students through their learning journey

Trainee teachers need a good stable emotional start to their careers to help them in turn have sector wide impact for the roles they will perform in wider society.

I will continue reflecting and seeking CPD to develop my online pedagogy. I am particularly interested in investigating all-class-response systems to engage all learners online.
