* [a breif history of learning theorys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgnd4rj2pT8)
    * 1950's
        * Behaviourism (Pavlov and Skinner 195x?) - rote learning
            * Desired behaviour rewarded
            * undesired behaviour punished
    * 1960's
        * Cognitivisum (Neisser 1967) - mental action or process of learning - brain is a computer
            * Revision for exams
    * 1970's
        * Constructivism (Bruner and Piaget)
            * Building our own understanding (requires effort)
            * Knowledge is constructed and not transmitted
    * 1980's
        * Socio Constructivism (Vytgostky 1978)
            * Piaget rejection _passive assimilation_
            * compare with other
            * Contextualisations and social interactions
            * Increased Motivation
            * Deep learning
            * Independent thoughts
    * 1990's ?? Experiential Learning (Kolb)
        * Kolb Cycle - reflect -> practice -> reflect -> practice

* [Course Design: constructive alignment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5hpRX5ZeIc) (Biggs 1999)
    * Constructive alignment (all the below should be aligned)
        * Intended learning outcomes 
            * (Bigs and Tang) statements from students perspective
            * Action verbs - design, plan, analyse
        * Teaching/Learning Activities
        * Assessment Feedback Tasks


* [Ray Land on Threshold Concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiNQAWFzULE&feature=emb_logo)
    * Gifted students still get stuck on aspects of their learning
    * Lenses are useful tools, but- focus/highlight an area and blur/background others
    * Inform curriculum design
        * Change the mode (field trip, lab, paper, theory)
    * Threshold concepts are (not in video)
        * Transformative
        * Irreversible
        * Integrative - expose previous hidden interrelatedness
        * Troublesome

Fixed/Growth Mindset (Dweeck 2006)


### OPAR framework
The most important thing to remember is: what do you want students to have learnt by the end of the session and how will you know to what extent they have learnt it?
* Orient
    * What’s the topic?
    * Why does this topic matter (to students/field/world)?
    * What do students already know about the subject?
    * How can you relate today’s topic to what students already know?
    * (5-10 minute chunk – ideally interactive/stimulating)
* Present
    * What are the core concepts/skills that you need to demonstrate or explain to students? 
    * How can you most effectively communicate these?
    * (5-10 min chunks)
* Apply
    * What can you feasibly get students to do during teaching time to let them practice the skill or applying the concepts/knowledge?
    * (In a 50 minute session, aim for 20+ mins of activities and remember to time allow for activity feedback/presentation)
* Review
    * How do you know that the students have learnt what you wanted them to have learnt?
    * (E.g. quiz, demonstration, presentation, poster-presentation, student generated summary, visiting working groups and listening-in)
    * Have you linked that back to the session aims?
    * In an hour long session you’d aim to spend the last 10 min on this

### Active Learning

* [Active Learning](http://geoffpetty.com/for-teachers/active-learning/) - Geoff Petty
    * set activities that require students to make their own meanings of the concepts
    * Same and different
        * one they are familiar with, and one they are presently studying
    * Graphic organisers
        * self-assess their own diagram using a model diagram provided by you
    * Decisions-Decisions
        * given a set of cards to match, group, rank, or sequence
            * order of importance, then sort them by who benefits, customer, business, supplier, or investor
            reject your 'spurious' cards
    * Feedback
        * self assessment and peer assessment
    * Hypothesis testing
        * a statement that is partly true, but partly false "The more advertising the better"
* Activities
    * [Formative Teaching Methods](http://geoffpetty.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/FormativeTeachingMethods2.doc)
        * active methods that provide the learner and the teacher with feedback

Groundrules for self and peer assessment
students must enter into the methods with the right spirit
Try to agree the following with your students
We will learn best if we all agree that

A Handbook for Teaching and Learning in Higher Education, fourth edition. Abingdon: Routledge. eBook publication date: 2015

Chapter 5 - Student Learning

HE Higher education not mass leccutre
Blame students as poor learners

Life skills, graducate attributes

Students learn by - doing
Teaching is hard
Graduates should be able to - reflect
Main challenge - too much ephemeral practical content

lense of 'not empty' - what do they have already and build on it

surface approach - just the test
deep approach - wholistic

constructivly aligned curriculum
differneceiated learning + encourage experiemntal creativity
protect against burnout

Students kind of default to _surface_
persuade them to swich mode to _deep_

Biggs and Tang 2009 - SOLO taxonomy
Pre structureal: misses the point
* unistructural: part of knowlege
* Multistructural: many facts, but not structured
* Relational: makes sense of key facts
* extended abstract: coherant whole
(verbs to define)

socio constructivisum


zone of proximal development (ZPD) - what learning is posisible in the environment - scaffold
communities of practice - learning communities
Legitimate periferal particippation - novice members of the comunit are given oppertunityes to be compitent participants (Lave and Wenger 1991)
 - thing pracgtice of excusion might be embedded

 


Kolb cycle
* Reflective observation (divergent)
* abstract conceptulisation (assimilation)
* Active exerpimentation (convergent)
* concreat experience (accomodator)

Myers Biggs inventory - bollox?


IQ is not correlated with bias




### PGCAP Success

Ongoing practice
Reflection ongoing
Schedule a build-up of evidence throughout the term - schedule
09:56
Model the behaviours we expect from our students
09:56
Schedule reading tasks
09:57
Always more stuff to do than there is time to do it. Understand urgent tasks are not always the most important
09:57
Make time!
09:58
Plan to get observed sooner rather than later
09:58
Solicit advice from peers
09:59
Engage with peers in an active way
10:00
Safe space - mindful that we should all be comfortable in making mistakes

Quiz's
-----

Kahoot - Rank annoys me (speed of answer shit) - music annoys me - I'm disadvantages by reading speed - Use Anoniumus name fro avoid highscore crap
'Shiny interactive tool'ed out

Anonnimous feedback - how?



---


Give the facts - pracice the task
Core psycology menonics
Sometimes just have to lecture
Done the reading - have to comment

Just given reading - they dont have the skills to digest it

---

Designate a note-taker


Debate?
Solo
How a theory or concpet ment a log to you and changed you


Done the reading - but don't have the skills to actually have got anything from it

          > and that the disabled person should make an extra effort (perhaps in time, effort, money, etc.) to ensure they do not inconvenience anyone else. 
          > They must change and adapt to fit the circumstances and their environment such as attending university.
    * Social model of disability -> person needs support -> low-income, negative attitudes, badly designed buildings
    * > your responsibility to ensure that your learning and teaching activities and materials are accessible.

### What is a university
* Liberal
    * Self realisation, meritocracy, knowledge is good
* Professional Formation
    * Gatekeepers to professions
* Research and Enterprise Engine
    * economic growth

(not really a type? they all encompase this)
1. Metaphysical
    * Develop as human beings, Freedom from ignorance, surer relationship with the world
2. Scientific
    * new knowleghe (research)
3. Entrepreneurial
    * Link to capital. Social as well as financial > growth
4. Bureaucratic
    * Procedures, data gathering

### HE Policies

* accelerated degrees and higher apprenticeships
* National Student Survey + other metrics now publicly visible
* Covid and 'value for money' debate

### Quality Assurance
What, why, who, how, where, when, how assessed, how evaluated

PGCE: Self-reflective, critical practitioners

Teaching is highly political - Ideology will influence curriculum design (1999 Toohey)

* Academic Planning process
* Program validation
* Periodc Origramme review
* Regulations polices
* External examiners

Students (now paying a lot) and investors





Session 2
---------

School approach - set the tasks
 self effacacy

### Barriers 
* fear
* self confidence, self esteem
* time
* prior education
* mature students (out of water?)
* Prior knowlege (expected?) review
* IT knowlege (for old and young) and teachers - we are all aweful

Cool quote:
"Uni is like paying Gym fees - you've got to show up"

### Support
* Well-being advisor
* Disability service
* Chaplaincy
* Peer mentoring
* Meditation services
* Students union advice

powerpoint has live subttling - live - presentation mode then TAB 'captioning/subtitling'

already
 respect individual learners
 promote partcipation (equality of oppertunity)
what now

I have a ADHD student. They have requested more breaks in sessions.
I have an older student that has alienated themselves for peer support network (they were kicked from WhatsApp group due to condescending/offensive comments) . Integrating them into group discussions is now much harder and I cant use pair work as most students in the group are on edge when working 1-to-1 with them.
To make progress I'm always using groups of 3+


Read reflections and show you care about the student

Support the student - look at wellbeing - identify the root causese. _Identifying_ is the majority of the battle




Session 3
---------

moved to [[_reflection]]


Session 4
---------





Prep slides
-----------

* What know, what not know
* Metric justification
* indipendent work to deadlines

D Bound
1. Measure achievement
2. Engender leaning
3. Develop graduate attributes

Principles of assessment
* Achive set learning outcomes
* Contributes to learning, engagement
* Authentic (reflects work-context, graduate attributes)
* Manageable
* inclusive
    * choice of task
    * understand the purpose and process of assessment

* Formative assessment
* Summative Assessment

* Assessment criteria
* Grade descriptor

* Nom-referenced assessment
    * only 20% are awarded destination (of cohort)
* Criterion-referenced assessment

Qualitys of effective feedback
1. Timely
    * (Uni 15 day turnaround)
2. Facilitates development of self-assessment (reflection)
3. High quality information to students about their learning
4. Encouarges teacher peer dialog
5. Encourages positive motivational belifes and sel-steam
6. provide oppertunity to close gap between current ans desired performance
7. Assist with further teacher planning

Giving feedback
* proise stratergy and effort
* engage student directly
* constuctive (rather than descriptive)
* encourage students to make use of feedback (give specific activity to act on feedback)
* Present mistakes as learning oppertunities


Session 4
---------

Why
Did they lean what's expected?
Support
Progress
Measure performance
Identify
Benchmark comparions, class, institution
Assessment to help students self regulate

SMART Objectives
Specific
Aeasurable
Achivable
Realistic
Timebound

Assessment-critera/Sylibus presented at the begining of course
Facilitate self-evaluation

13:30 to 13:50

Stress of getting responses from students

Stress from getting responses from students remotely
If not summative-graded - students may not engage
Continuous verbal feedback on practical tasks
Students not engaging with pre-reading
Reading reflections and commenting on reflection progress in 1-to-1 meetings
Feedback about study skills and attendance

No point in giving feedback that outstripts the students engagement
Focus/Limit feedback to specific target item - Leverage

Submit one draft for feedback - summative is grade only (because students complain about inconsistent marking)

Feedback for draft progress - recorded (verbally is not sufficent?)
Grade only for summative

Feedback authtnetic and matters
Timely
Mark the work, not the individual?

### Activity
1. Focus - borderline fail / pass
    * focus on one point - little sense of direction/conclusion
    * does have conclusion
2. Evaluation
    * Fail
        * no planned future action - no link to evidence
3. Reflection + application
    * Borderline fail
        * Limited reflective case to theory
4. scholarshop/research
    * borderline fail
        * limited evidence of relative profetinal practice
5. quality of written
    * borderline fail
        * not a complete assignment. prose is chatty and unreflective

What are the sources of imformation?
What emthoods can I use
What are the advantages and disavatages of these methods
When do I want to do the evaluation

In class surveys
Online evaluation
Informal questions
External examination to evaluate asessment
personal reflection

* [What’s in a Name: Exposing Gender Bias in Student Ratings of Teaching](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10755-014-9313-4) Diriscoll and Hunt 2014
    * It is possible to disguise an instructor’s gender identity online. 
    * assistant instructors in an online class each operated under two different gender identities. 
    * Students rated the male identity significantly higher than the female identity, regardless of the instructor’s actual gender, demonstrating gender bias. 
    * Given the vital role that student ratings play in academic career trajectories, this finding warrants considerable attention.

Questions:
* If retention is of upmost importance - attempt to reject pereieved weaker candidates for lower socio-economic
    * _Access_ seems to be in conflict with _Rettention_
    * Students from lower socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to drop out than those from more advantaged backgrounds

    * Tweet size summary (140 chars)
    * List the activitiy type (six learning types above) and analyse the spread of tasks - 
        * _module profile_ radar graph
* [A reflexive evaluation of technology-enhanced learning ](https://journal.alt.ac.uk/index.php/rlt/article/view/1998)
    * Exeter et al. (2010, p. 762) who state, ‘student engagement refers to the time, energy and resources spent on activities’. These activities can refer to peer discussions, attendance in class, completion of set tasks and preparing for assignments.
    * Rudduck (1978) highlights this as a common problem arguing that there is a cultural boundary between the tutor and the students that can prevent students from engaging during sessions.
    * Given that students’ communication norms are now marked by ‘tweets’ and online chats (Dean and Fornaciari 2014), learning technologies facilitate communication in large settings while doing so in their ‘language’ (Attwell and Hughes 2010).
    * Described by Siemens (2005) as ‘a learning theory for the digital age’, _connectivism_ is reflective of underlying social environments which have, in the last 20 years, been reorganised by the emergence of technology. Highlighting the limitations of behaviourism, cognitivism and constructivism, Siemens (2005) proposes that the inclusion of technology in learning activities begins to move learning theories into the digital age. 
    * > …the Google Community blurs the line between an academic platform and social media; it was easier to communicate with my dissertation supervisor in a more informal manner which created a space to ask questions that perhaps I would not ask via email.
    * Constructive alignment (Biggs 1996) appeared to be of importance for the students, whereby they could clearly see the links between the online activities, classroom discussions and final assessment.
    * Caution must be added that we do not suggest technology-enhanced learning is right for every single module on a course, and any integration of technology should avoid the wear out effect (Wang 2015). This is reflected in the very essence of digital pedagogy which is about approaching learning tools from a critical perspective and, thus, also considers when digital tools should not be used. Ultimately, digital tools should only serve to enhance learning experiences and cannot replace the value of human interaction (McNeely 2017). 
    * Asynchronous learning and social media communities work best if students are placed within smaller workable groups, whereby they feel more part of the learning experience and can converse with their peers helping to form communities of practice.

Notes for reflections

* Citizenship - not guided
* Other practicioners - same - students are not able to engage in discussion as they lack the practical experience
* Debacle of networking modules
* We care abou tthe students - that leads to another problem - we can be exploited

* criteria for asessing the efftiveness of learning technologies

* ABC
    * Framework for review what it is that you are currently doing

### Graduate Attributes

* Instructor/Teacher to talk about the meta narrative of the Graduate Attributes in lessons.

* 20% not in skill employment after 3.5 years
    * (how do they track this?)
* [Canterbury.ac.uk Graduate Attributes](https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/learning-and-teaching-enhancement/strategies/graduate-attributes.aspx)
* [The Biggest Hurdles Recent Graduates Face Entering the Workforce](https://hbr.org/2019/04/the-biggest-hurdles-recent-graduates-face-entering-the-workforce)
    * Because in the end, what we found in our work is that the book smarts students have received from their college education will only get them so far.
    * Feedback
        * In college, feedback is clear and consistent. You have a syllabus, which details the requirements
        * > Throughout my entire life from the beginning of school everything was graded. You could get immediate feedback on your performance. But at work, you’re not getting that immediate feedback… and I think that was one of the biggest challenges throughout that transition
    * Relationships
        * Relationships in the professional world are also very different from in college.
        * In college, you build relationships with people you want to — and for the most part with people around your same age
    * Accountability
        * > “When you’re young coming out of college, you don’t realize what you’re walking into. You either perform or you don’t, and you could lose your job any day. Students think it’s easy-going just like school, but it’s nothing like that. It’s a lot more responsibility.”
        * Mentoring is of course a critical part of this process, but remember that more experienced mentors aren’t necessarily better. What’s essential is finding mentors who have experience of both sides of the transition
* [CCCU Framework for Employability](https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/career-development/docs/CCCU-Framework-for-Developing-Enterprising-Professional-Graduates-Framework-2019-2024.pdf)
    * Working on Your Self:
        * Increasing self-awareness and reflection
        * Enhancing your professionalism
        * Developing an enterprising mind set
    * Working on your Potential: 
        * Improving your attributes and skills
        * Marketing and promoting yourself
        * Applying subject knowledge
    * Working on your Future:

What professional skills are you already developing in your classroom teaching and activity setting

What could you potentially develop

How are you or can you ensure your students understand for themselves that they are developing professional skills in this setting? 

How can you ensure your students understand that they provide examples for CVs, personal statements and interview examples? 


* My Interview question
    * What did you do autonomously? (Rather than being told to by your course)

Level 6+

Literature review task - training our students
TASK: Find a paper on xxx and bring it to the session
Crtique! Limitation (not "rubbish", not "problems")

In first session - class decides how to sanction non-contributors
Sign the class charter
Most prepared were grouped together - weaked/unprepared grouped together
They choose how to post who brings what paper - first added "owns" the paper

Students are uncomforatble about not being lectured too

When a student realisese they have responsibility of being a co-learner, they become unconfident and anxious and want to be taught.
I don't want to be a partener in learning, I want to be taught

Students know things that you don't
Document disscussion - have tangable takeaways - POST ALL YOUR NOTES!

Conclusions

·        Trying to activate students as _active participants_ of their own learning.
·        Give students _responsibility_ for learning and allowing them to be enriched by the experience.
·        Utilising different learning techniques through peer learning improving access for students with varied learning styles and diverse background.
·        Trying to quantify/qualify the access of student partnership can seem artificial or ‘tick boxy’.
·        Instead of being “sage on stage”, “guide on the side”.
·        Important for fulfilling graduate outcomes.
·        Students can help us to understand their experiences and challenges.

Gaps in Research
·        If students are learning from one another, does it meet quality standards.
·        What are the outcomes of more student-directed learning?
·        What about the quietest or more reticent of students?
·        Bringing students in as partners to be more actively involved may be a way of relieving the workload of lecturers: allowing taught sessions to be of a greater quality because they are spread less thinly.
·        Can students ever be ‘true partners’ when lecturers hold the position of power in the form of assessment?

* [Eduflow: Encourage Better Peer Feedback with Our Guide to Feedback Rubrics](https://www.eduflow.com/blog/encourage-better-peer-feedback-with-our-guide-to-feedback-rubrics)
    * Matrix rubrics are useful for grading an assignment but they aren’t as useful for promoting individualized learning.
        * Peer feedback rubrics might include scale questions (simar to matrix but no set scale), but they also employ open-ended questions that students must answer as they review their classmate’s assignment.
            * Does the 'thing' x and y
            * Prompt for higher order thinking
            * Kind, justified, specific
    * Prompt should benefit reviewer and revewee
    * Show exemplars (of work and feedback) and cover the metacognative process
    * 


Peer assessment

* Happy for peer assesment if not toward summative grade
* Setup at start of course!
    * They have a role to play in their learning (not just the lecturers job)
    * Self regulated lifelong learners/participants - graduate attributes - profetional compitence
* Fear of negativity - how to improve - balanced feedback
* Need for anonymity - anonymous and no "comeback" - digital (no handwriting)
    * Do not discuss out of dignital environment
* Peer can say things that lecturers cannot
    * Lectueres have to be risrained abnd posetive to avoid damage
    * (is this not in conflict with fear of negativity above)
