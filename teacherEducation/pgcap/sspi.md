Timekeeping school - functional norms

Number of interactions - wider comunity

Only parent perspective

Parents have Serious social problems themselfs - context?


Control the socialisation

What does socialisation mean


* Comunuty routine of comunity
sports - volenteering
Number of interacitons 2min not statistically signigicant

"Research documenbts quite clearly"?

All peers are not friends?


* rules behaviours and attitudfes


More mature and better socialised

Pleasent when lost game?

* function as effective members of socity

69% - post secondary educuation




Session 1
---------

* [Action Research: Practice Guide](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/knowledge-hub/action-research-practice-guide)

Must have ethical clearendce
Action research is not PhD research



* practicalas it involves making change to practice;
* theoreticalas it is informed by theory and can generate new insights;
* collaborativeas it encourages engagement with others in the process;
* reflexive as it requires practitioner researchers to keep their own knowledge,values,and professional activities under review;
* contextual as it acknowledges institutional, national, historical and societal influences.

Specific question?
Pro-active rather than reactive

Do our work in a more structured way
 has a result - formal structure

Is out interactive approach working? try the old fasioned?

Collaborative - dynamic - ongoing
People involved are responsible for an intervention
Cyclical
Not just passive collection of data

Reflective cycle - with data collection to make it more formal

Iterative improvement


Control groups?
Implied consent? from being in class?
It's about the "Intent" of the intervention?
Does the end justify the means? Depends on model of ethics used.
Ethically sound on paper, but the implementation is just someone wanting to push their ideas/addenda.


Specific focus which you are trying to improve in the activity of research.
“future-oriented”, emphasis of AR appears to be on improvement of the status quo rather than merely delineating facts.

Does not look at theoretical hypotheses but rather application of practice with hey hypotheses relating to improving the practice

### Reviewing a paper

* [Home Schooling and the Question of Socialization](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1493091) Medlin 2000
    * Aweful paper

* [Wow, just wow. If you think Psychological Science was bad in the 2010-2015 era, you can’t imagine how bad it was back in 1999](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2021/06/16/wow-just-wow-if-you-think-psychological-science-as-bad-in-the-2010-2015-era-you-cant-imagine-how-bad-it-was-back-in-1999/)
    * 

#### Criteria for selection and citation of papers - Systematic review
* [Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_Reporting_Items_for_Systematic_Reviews_and_Meta-Analyses)

Meta Analysis - 10 studies rather than one study

#### Don't's

* Cite 5 of your own paper
* Heavy reliance on one source
* Must have some form of their own research/input/progress. (Not just secondary). State if it is a "literature review" (these have a different structure)
* Don't just hold up your own ideal.
* Biased Sample - of only parents that have withdrawn their kids from school.
* Just describe (be analytical)
* Don't make broard sweeping generaisations "all x"

#### Do's

* Template: Abstract, context, definitions, data, 
* Are the conclusions supported by the results
Context - e.g. "Home schooling in XYZ" would have helped. It paports to be "All Home Schooling" - America (a different setting)
What are the reasons these children are being home schooled?
Middle/upper class - 

* How would you evaluate:
    * Qualitative source?
    * Primary research source?
    * Literature review?
    * Action research?
Seminal source? anecdotally lots of people accept - a major study that unveils an idea - insprited a lot of research in an particular area. defined a term. Where a branch of research comes from.
number of citations?

Checklists for looking at sources
* [PRISMA Checklist](http://prisma-statement.org/prismastatement/Checklist.aspx) - The PRISMA 2020 statement comprises a 27-item checklist addressing the introduction, methods, results and discussion sections of a systematic review report.
* [CHECKLIST: EVALUATING SOURCES - Is this source reliable?](https://style.mla.org/app/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/Checklist-for-Evaluating-Sources.pdf)
* [Methodological quality (risk of bias) assessment tools for primary and secondary medical studies: what are they and which is better?](https://mmrjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40779-020-00238-8) 2020 Yang, Wang, Ma, et al
    * Assess quality of methodology
    * Mostly quantitative
* [STANDARD QUALITY ASSESSMENT CRITERIA for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields](ihe.ca/download/standard_quality_assessment_criteria_for_evaluating_primary_research_papers_from_a_variety_of_fields.pdf) 
    * More qualitative
    * Are the conclusions supported by the results


Advice for writing
------------------

* Show you are aware of context and limitations of the sources you use

Your voice
When it is the source, when is it you

paraphrasing

Semi structued interviews
quantative
qualiative

Colour code your writing!! What's your's what's the source
