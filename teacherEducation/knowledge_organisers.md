Knowledge Organisers and Mind Maps (30min)

* [Organising knowledge: The purpose and pedagogy of knowledge organisers](https://impact.chartered.college/article/organising-knowledge-purpose-pedagogy-knowledge-organisers/) MARK MILLER September 2018 [BlackBoard pdf](https://learn.canterbury.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-2681383-dt-content-rid-4010508_1/xid-4010508_1)
    * > A knowledge organiser (KO) sets out the important, useful and powerful knowledge on a topic on a single page (Kirby, 2015). With the content demands of new courses, and schools adopting a knowledge-based curriculum, these are becoming increasingly popular in schools

    * > “My students just keep forgetting everything - even though I’ve taught it to them over and over again!”
    * > Knowledge Organisers are an increasingly popular teaching method in schools and simply involve distilling the key information for a term’s teaching, or a topic, onto 1 side of A4 – similar to a graphic organiser.
      > This Knowledge Organiser is given to students as #homework on Show My Homework with instructions for students and parents on how the students can test themselves, and how the parents can test their children, to memorise as much of the key information as possible.

    * > most schools don’t have self-quizzing cultures built in. Students don’t use them effectively and just copy words across blindly without self-quizzing.
      > Worse than that, the KO’s are just stuck into students’ books (or reside at the bottom of their bags) and are never looked at again. 
      > This is a waste of time, but it certainly doesn’t mean that KOs are a bad idea. All it means is that – like everything else – inventions work best when resources, practice and purpose are aligned.
* [The 6 most common mistakes students make when mind mapping](https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/6-common-mind-mapping-mistakes)
    * Mistake 1 – Using only words
        * Dual coding - diagrams/pictographs
    * Mistake 2 - Using too many words
        * Redundancy effect
    * Mistake 3 - Wasting time making it too pretty
        * form of procrastination
    * Mistake 4 – Not using Elaborative Interrogation
        * Re-reading is insufficient revision
        * "why is this true?" or "why might this be the case?"
    * Mistake 5 – Not utilising Retrieval Practice
        * they don’t actually test whether they understand what they’re written
        * try 15min time-box to replicate mind-map from memory
    * Mistake 6 - Not transferring mind map knowledge
