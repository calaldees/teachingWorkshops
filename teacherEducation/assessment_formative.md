Formative Assessment
====================

* Jamie Clarke (Graphic Artist) [Formative Assessment Moving Learners Forward](https://www.jamieleeclark.com/graphics) poster - This one-pager summarises Dylan Wiliam and Siobhán Leahy’s five formative assessment strategies that teachers can use to support learning.

* [Developing the theory of formative assessment](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/9119063/Black2009_Developing_the_theory_of_formative_assessment.pdf) 2009 Dylan Wiliam, Paul Black
    * (Reasonably heavy reading - My Notes)
    * Aims
        1. provide a unifying basis for the diverse practices which are said to be formative.
        2. to locate formative interactions within more comprehensive theories of pedagogy.
        3. linking our analysis to other theoretical writing about learning interactions
        4.  suggests ways to extend and/or improve those practices.
        5.  offer suggestion about such (future) enquiries.
    * How these were connected not previously articulated
        * Sharing success criteria with learners
        * Classroom questioning
        * Comment-only marking
        * Peer- and self-assessment
        * Formative use of summative tests
    * requirements
        * Establishing where the learners are in their learning
        * Establishing where they are going
        * Establishing what needs to be done to get them there
    * "Almost" and "Nearly" are the norm in most classrooms, as teacher trys to move to "The Correct Response"
        * What the learner actually hears and interprets is necessarily what the student intended to convey.
    * Student distracted, board, other conflicting goal other than growth goals;
    * > A search for well-being implies that students are more concerned with maintaining or restoring positive feelings than with the pursuit of growth goals.
    * Pulled off the growth track and onto the well-being track
    * the teacher’s problem: on receipt of a response, she has to decide how the student came to make it
        * inadequate growth strategy
            * such as working with a mis-conception, 
        * or using a well-being strategy
        * Misunderstood question or language, mislead by aspect of question
        * Not understood quality criteria of required answer
        * all questions only have one answer?
        * Using an answer that was correct but outside the teachers identification
    * Point out perceived flaw or open exploratory discussion to find reasoning behind answer
    * Vygotskys work centers around
        * development == requires changes in the psychological functions available to the learner, 
        * learning == the acquisition of new mental capabilities, without changes in the available psychological functions
    * creating cognitive conflict rather than giving answers 
        * the importance of dialogue to serve the social construction of knowledge, and to meta-cognition involving learners’ reflection on their own learning, makes it clear that formative assessment practices are an essential feature
    * "Big Question" Universal pedagogy - present proposals - teaching brings it all together
    * > teachers often behave as if they believed that they could do the learning for the learner, with disastrous consequences
    * Categories of feedback
        * (high effective) information about task and how to perform it more effectively (low) target settings, (lower) praise/punishment
        * (effective) when learners confidence in feedbacks production is high
        * task level feedback
        * process level feedback (advice-organiser)
        * self regulation feedback
