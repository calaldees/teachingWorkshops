Computational Thinking
----------------------

What are the skills of reasoning and problem solving in Computer Science and how are computing departments addressing these?

* Computational Thinking
    * Components
        * Decomposition
        * Pattern Recognition/DataOrganisation
        * Generalisation/Abstraction
        * Algorithms
    * Info
        * [BBC Bitesize](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zp92mp3/revision/1)
        * [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking)
        * [Computational Thinking for a Computational World - digitalpromise.org](http://digitalpromise.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/dp-comp-thinking-v1r5.pdf)
        * > When defining what computational thinking is, it is also helpful to establish what it is not: that is, humans thinking like a computer. In fact, it is just the opposite. Computational thinking is a uniquely human ability


Schemes of Work
---------------
Planning for progression - Building schemata

A scheme of work implements a syllabus.
* [Curriculum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum) Wikipedia
    * > Curriculum is broadly defined as the totality of student experiences that occur in the educational process.
    * > The term often refers specifically to a planned sequence of instruction, or to a view of the student's experiences in terms of the educator's or school's instructional goals
* [Syllabus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabus) Wikipedia
    * A syllabus or specification is a document that communicates information about a specific academic course or class and defines expectations and responsibilities. It is generally an overview or summary of the curriculum.
* [Scheme of work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_of_work) Wikipedia
    * > the structure and content of an academic course (syllabus). 
      > It splits an often-multi-year curriculum into deliverable units of work,
    * May include
        * Content
        * Objectives or Outcomes
        * Methods of delivery (student and teacher activity)
        * Assessment strategies
        * Resources

In KS3 - 3 Years is a long time - time to forget - revisit topics multiple times over a 3 year period. e.g. Most years have some kind of web work, network work, programming work, etc

Cognitive Load Theory (explored more next session _howStudentsLearn_)
> Working memory should be seen as short term and finite, 
> whereas long-term memory can be seen as infinite. 


### Comparing school approaches for progression (1 hour)

Reminder: 
* KS3 == Year 7 to Year 9 (Level 0 to 1)
* KS4 == Year 10 and Year 11 (Level 1 to 2)

Your familiar with [KS3 Computing National Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study#key-stage-3)

TASK 1: In pairs, compare the KS3 resources you have acquired from your school. (20min)

Make notes on + be prepared to present
1. How do the topics map to the National Curriculum? (is this specified?)
2. What are the links between topics for year 1, 2, 3?
    * What kind of progression are the creators thinking about?
3. What similarities/differences are there between the schemes of work?

(10min group confer)

TASK 2: Explore other KS3 SOW online (20min)
1. Other than the sequence of content, what other teaching resources are provided?
2. Would you be able to teach any of these units with the resources provided?

Textbooks for teaching Computing? (45min)
--------------------------------

* [Textbooks for the teaching of computing](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/441674/1/Textbooks.pdf) John Woollard CAS 2020
    * Objectives
        1. To what extent would high-quality textbooks raise the quality of teaching and learning in computing at school?
        2. Is it advantageous to have such books available in physical hard copy?
        3. Is there a shortage of such textbooks?
        4. Where would lack of textbooks sit in a priority list of obstacles to high quality computing education at school?
        5. How can publishers be encouraged to produce materials for teaching computing?
    * Good
        * impact (statistically significant at the 5%)
        * makes authoritative, higher degree of quality assurance. 
        * out-of-school learning
        * independent learning, behaviour management (isolation activities)
        * Cognitive benefit of tangible textbooks. Ability to flip back and forth between pages. Provides more mental clarity.
        * act as the programme of learning
    * Against
        * Outdate (external links)
        * Physical books no active element
        * Requires literacy
        * Teachers can edit/adapt
        * Cost


### Textbook Scheme of work example
We are going to explore a sample sequence of lessons

As well as free resources teachers share online. There are also paid for resources.

* [Compute-IT](https://www.hoddereducation.co.uk/compute-it) - Computing for Key Stage 3
    * Endorsed by Computing at School
    * 3 textbook series (a Computing textbox for students. How much is a class set?)
    * Additional teaching resources online
    * Example Lesson progression - Shapes
        * [Compute-IT 1: Unit 3 Lesson 1](http://my.dynamic-learning.co.uk/ViewLesson.aspx?i=DC06DC60-5268-417B-98AF-E81CE0E4B5D7&l=2556958&u=e27bc3ac-2aa5-4aa7-8601-b58991e957e9&vle=true) - Shapes

TASK: Explore this lesson progression (15min)
Questions:
* Would you be able to teach this? Why?
* Would you want to teach this? Why?
DISCUSSION: (15min)

### Other peoples resources (15min)

> Hattie also makes the point that buying, or using, someone else's scheme of work makes teachers less effective because they spend less time thinking about the curriculum as a whole, and that teachers and departments that create their own curriculum or scheme of work have more "impact".

* [twitter](https://twitter.com/mikercameron/status/1435123936962940929)
    * Mike Cameron @mikercameron
        * > New rule:-
          > All materials produced in school are Crown Copyright and must be made available on a public facing website in an editable format.
          > If DfE is serious about reducing teacher workload this would do it.
    * Mark Enser @EnserMark
        * > I'm not sure this would help workload. Geography teachers are great at uploading their resources on to free sharing sites but the time it has taken me to find something I want to use is always more than the time it would take me to produce it myself.

Discussion: 
* Are other teachers resources helpful to us? Why/Why not?
* How/Why/When would you use other teachers resources?
* How will you use them in your training?

Practical Exploration (30min)
---------------------

Explore shape drawing tools

#### [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)

15min?

![Scratch Pattern](./images/scratch_algorithm_art.png)

(Can't fill shapes in scratch)

#### Python [Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) Graphics

15min?

```python
import turtle
t = turtle.Pen()
t.forward(100)
```
```python
def example_function(my_para1, my_param2):
    t.fd(my_para1)
    t.rt(my_param2)

example_function(10,20)
```

    * House?
    * Snowman?
    * Tree (filled circles or triangles)?


Context Based Learning and Relevancy (30min lecture)
------------------------------------

If Computing is to be relevant to world they live in, then make Computing encompasses the world. Wherever possible make Computing have _Cultural_ and/or _Community_ context

Young people can smell bullshit. 
Things I try to avoid:
* Fake themes
    * Harry potter tuck shop spreadsheets
    * Ponys
* Try to avoid computer games as a theme
    * These can alienate some demographics immediately
    * > Games are pointless, they don't do anything (for the world)
* Tasks for the sake of a task
    * "Add these number together", "Why", "Because it's the task"
    * (This is less of a problem for A-Level as they have chosen the subject)

        * Living Greener: How can technology help us protect our planet?

        * Living Longer: How can technology meet the needs of an ageing society?


### Real World Context for the Pen/Turtle skills learnt above
* Decomposition of geomentirc artwork - cultural context
    * [Theo van Doesburg](https://www.google.com/search?q=Theo+van+Doesburg&tbm=isch) (artist using geometric squares and lines)
    * [Simple Celtic artwork](https://www.google.com/search?q=simple+celtic+artwork&tbm=isch) (circles)
    * [Simple Islamic artwork](https://www.google.com/search?q=simple+islamic+artwork&tbm=isch) (repeating geometric patterns/colors)

By adding context you immediately unlock further computational thinking skills: analysis, decomposition, algorithms
