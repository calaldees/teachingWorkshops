Computer Science as a field/discipline

* [computer science: student myths and misconceptions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234832735_Computer_science_student_myths_and_misconceptions) of the field in general (Beaubouef, McDowell 2008)
    * > common myths and misconceptions about the field of computer science. It addresses and attempts to dispel these notions in an effort to provide prospective computer science students and the general public with a more realistic view of the field

    * Computing occupations are projected to grow at a higher rate than all other STEM areas combined.
    * Regardless of their career, many professionals will be using computer science at work.
    * most "human executable recipes" cannot be implemented by a machine. This misconception actually leads people to misunderstand algorithms and therefore overestimate what a machine can do.
    *  "transfer hypothesis." a thinking skill automatically transfers into other domains simply by being present in the brain. This is not true
    * Misconceptions
        * CS = programming
        * Programming is concerned with expressing a solution to a problem as notation in a language. 
        * Once you master a core knowledge base including variables, sequencing, conditionals, loops, abstraction, modularization, and decomposition, you will be a computing professional.
        * Programming is easy to learn.
        * Computational thinking is the driver of programming skill.
        * When we engage in everyday step-by-step procedures we are thinking computationally
        * Computational thinking improves problem-solving skills in other fields.
        * CS is basically science and math. The engineering needed to produce the technology is all based on the science and math.
        * Old CS is obsolete. The important developments in CS such as AI and big data analysis are all recent.

    * It’s only for boys
    * It’s going to be required for every job in the future
    * It’s all about programming
    * It’s too complicated for younger students
    * Computer science is hard to integrate into core subjects

    * Pupils will just surf the web all day
    * Children spend enough time in front of screens already
    * Computers are making my child less, not more, clever

    * Number of students taking Computer Science (male/female split)
    * Number of teachers training to teach computing
        * Missing targets every year
    * Summary of all the GCSE and A-Level exam boards
    * > GCSE Computer Science was the least popular choice (out of Foreign Languages, Arts, Design and technology, Humanities, and Computer Science).
    * conclusion
        * > The participation (by cohort) in England has remained quite static at around 13% over the past five years
        * > BCS has been promoting the idea that there is a need to triple the number of young people taking up the Computing qualifications at Key Stage 4 in England 
        * > Computing in UK higher education institutions (2019/20) shows that it is the 6th most popular degree group
