    * Learner rearranges the lines of code to solve the task
    * benefit of Parson’s Problems is that the learner is focusing on the structure and logic of blocks of code, rather than the syntax of individual text elements (atoms). The process reduces the cognitive load experienced by learners, allowing them to practise sequencing and problem-solving with code.
