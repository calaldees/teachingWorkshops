Assessment - KS3

National Curriculum Assessment
------------------------------

TASK: The National Curriculum is a page of A4? How would you report a grade to your school and to parents?
Discussion

(Many people have spent 100's of hours deliberating over mechanisms to do this. I'm asking you, as beginners to do this in 10min. It's a deliberately overwhelming task to get you to understand the magnitude of the problem)


"How do you report grades/progress in KS3" - however you like - it's the wild west!

Some just use GCSE grades for KS3. This is not what GCSE grades were designed for - there is some missing overlap KS3/KS4
