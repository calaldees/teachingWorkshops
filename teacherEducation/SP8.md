--------

* Inclusion Week
    * Experiences
    * Changes to your mental model? (your computing teaching)
* Review of ePortfolio
    * Lessons you Observed
    * Lesson packs to date
        * (split up solid paragraphs into points!)
* Review of SP1 Writeup
    * Critical evaluation of learning theories
* Preparation for Developing Teaching Phase (DTP)
    * Bundle class?
    * Lesson plan workshop/practice

* SPR1
    * 

Stumble Upon
------------

* [Joy.js](https://ncase.me/joy/)
    * a pedagogic tool?
    * cross curricular? could you approach a science, maths or music teachers? would they be interested?

Mental Models
-------------

* Factual errors
    * Simple atomic facts
* Broken models
    * Addressed with logic and reasoning
* Fundamental beliefs
    * No idea that computers could do that - or used like that - or had that impact

Questions: 
1. How do you help identify mental models?
2. How do you help develop mental models?

* Competent people have a mental model of how to approach a common/regular task (e.g. debugging code). Competent people have constructed a model of what to do 'in advance of the problem'.
    * e.g. removing an audience from a difficult student, dropping a lesson completely to tackle a racial or sexual slur.

<summary>Steps to take to fix a bug ...</summary>

* reproduce the bug
* perform a git bisect, or review recent PRs, if it seems to be a recent regression
* read the stacktrace
* inspect the state of the code with a debugger or print statements
* look at unit tests or PRs to learn the expected usage of particular modules
* ask for help from someone with more domain-specific expertise
