Notes

* What does a great computing ITT curriculum include?
    * Criticality (we also imbue this with eSaftey)
    * iMedia (pedagogy is different)
    * Practical examples / case studies
        * I don't find many schools engaging with innovative concepts - reuse of existing guidance/patterns
* What does great in-school support look like for computing trainees?
    * Alignment between mentor/school and tutor/university
    * Another level/layer if needed
* What does a great assessment of trainees subject knowledge and development look like?
    * GCSE (time of year the worst for trainee teachers)
* What does a great ITT reading list include?
    * ?? Time to absorb?
    * [What If Everything You Knew About Education Was Wrong?](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Everything-About-Education-Wrong-Paperback/dp/1785831577/)
    * [Teaching Tech Together: How to create and deliver lessons that work and build a teaching community around them](https://teachtogether.tech/) 2019 Greg Wilson
        * Outstanding Computing pedagogical advice
        * Free eBook or [paperback](https://www.routledge.com/Teaching-Tech-Together-How-to-Make-Your-Lessons-Work-and-Build-a-Teaching/Wilson/p/book/9780367352974)

Nicola - Edge Hill
Neil - External examiner
Jonny - Teach First - Subject development lead
Amy - Warrington - Computing Hub lead

More Hubs and support networking for ECT's and beyond - is it worth running anymore - a comminuty is important - KPI's for hubs!
Network of Mentors - Reading group? - Present the paper (then discuss)
Google Certified traininer (education platform) - Level 1 certified educator certificate

Session for what does Ofseted research guidence mean

Opening mentor training to people wanting to become mentors

Edge Hill - 40 people!!! Community meet?!


* More 2:2's in recruitment
* More leaving than entering the profession (universally for 2011 to 2017)
* 46% have a post A-Level computing qualification
* Computing teachers spend longer on lesson planning (NSCR?)
* Data suggests workload is the biggest reason for leaving the profession
* Bursaries don't make much difference
* Identified the biggest professional development need

Problems
* Just for the bursary  - but recruitment so low - give anyone a 'chance'

Hi all,

 

Thanks so much to all of you who managed to attend last night’s meeting and to Matt and Nicola for all your help organising and facilitating.

 

It was a great rich discussion and I was left with a number of ideas buzzing in my head!

 

I have attached the slides from the meeting and where possible I have referenced the data in the notes.

 

I have tried to summarise some of these discussions below:

 

    How can we best support mentors in school – there’s certainly something we can do about this common issue of non-specialist mentors working with trainees and a range of formal and informal support we can offer.

Part of this is around connecting those that are computing teachers and want to mentor but don’t have a trainee and how we can bring these people together.

 

    Trainee teacher recruitment – how can we work on diversifying the teachers we are recruiting and supporting those best with non-subject specialisms? Is there something here we can progress about bringing back the bursaries for trainees etc? 

 

    Getting the balance right of subject knowledge development and PCK throughout teacher development. Ideas around testing/auditing of subject knowledge and use of SKEs

 

    What is the best forum for this network, ideas around CAS, TPEA, and Chartered college? We will explore places to host our network and come back to you with progress – if anyone has thoughts on the best way forward with this please reach out to me. 

 

Next steps:

 

    There will be one meeting a term so look out for dates for a meeting in the spring term. 

 

    We will be setting up a network page to keep the conversations going and signpost to @Nicola Looker reading group – look out for ones coming soon on the Ofsted Research Review. 

 

 

My overwhelming feeling at the end of the meeting was how lucky we are to have such a committed and open subject community in this area!

There is something powerful about speaking to others doing similar roles so thank you for taking the time!

 

My inbox and Twitter DMs are open so please reach out with any feedback on what you would find useful and how we can drive this group forward!

 

Thanks,

Rachel

Hi Computing Mentors,

I've recently got involved with a national group of Computing Mentors/Educators and attended their first remote meeting earlier in the year.
This could be a great resource to network with other Computing mentors across the country.
The next meeting will be on "Wednesday 19th April 16:00 - 17:30pm via Google meet" (see below for agenda and join link). 

The group is organised by Rachel Arthur. rarthur@teachfirst.org.uk https://twitter.com/MsArthurCompSci
You can contact her to be added to her mailing list if you are interested.

This looks like a very topical and relevant new emerging group. The meetings are every 3 months-ish. I'm interested in how this group is going to grow.

I will be in touch with you all soon to organise a second mentor visit.
Keep in touch.
