The Computing Teacher Educator Network Meeting 1 
================================================

* What does a great computing ITT curriculum include?
    * Criticality (we also imbue this with eSaftey)
    * iMedia (pedagogy is different)
    * Practical examples / case studies
        * I don't find many schools engaging with innovative concepts - reuse of existing guidance/patterns
* What does great in-school support look like for computing trainees?
    * Alignment between mentor/school and tutor/university
    * Another level/layer if needed
* What does a great assessment of trainees subject knowledge and development look like?
    * GCSE (time of year the worst for trainee teachers)
* What does a great ITT reading list include?
    * ?? Time to absorb?
    * [What If Everything You Knew About Education Was Wrong?](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Everything-About-Education-Wrong-Paperback/dp/1785831577/)
    * [Teaching Tech Together: How to create and deliver lessons that work and build a teaching community around them](https://teachtogether.tech/) 2019 Greg Wilson
        * Outstanding Computing pedagogical advice
        * Free eBook or [paperback](https://www.routledge.com/Teaching-Tech-Together-How-to-Make-Your-Lessons-Work-and-Build-a-Teaching/Wilson/p/book/9780367352974)

Nicola - Edge Hill
Neil - External examiner
Jonny - Teach First - Subject development lead
Amy - Warrington - Computing Hub lead

More Hubs and support networking for ECT's and beyond - is it worth running anymore - a comminuty is important - KPI's for hubs!
Network of Mentors - Reading group? - Present the paper (then discuss)
Google Certified traininer (education platform) - Level 1 certified educator certificate

Session for what does Ofseted research guidence mean

Opening mentor training to people wanting to become mentors

Edge Hill - 40 people!!! Community meet?!


* More 2:2's in recruitment
* More leaving than entering the profession (universally for 2011 to 2017)
* 46% have a post A-Level computing qualification
* Computing teachers spend longer on lesson planning (NSCR?)
* Data suggests workload is the biggest reason for leaving the profession
* Bursaries don't make much difference
* Identified the biggest professional development need

Problems
* Just for the bursary  - but recruitment so low - give anyone a 'chance'
