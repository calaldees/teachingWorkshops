Hi all, 

Hope you are well and starting to see the signs of spring coming wherever you are! 

We wanted to invite you to meeting number 2 of the Computing Teachers Educators Network.
 
This group is an informal opportunity to meet and collaborate with others that work with trainee teachers in some capacity. From in-school mentors to university course leads we come together to support each other. 

The next meeting will take place on Wednesday 19th April 16:00 - 17:30pm via Google meet: : https://meet.google.com/evh-vknk-eyx

We are bringing to you a discussion on: 

    An update on the progress of the network from our last meeting 
        Where is this network going to live
        Mentoring - support for non subject mentors
    Ofsted for Computing ITT 
        What does the Ofsted research review mean for us?
    How we a tracking subject knowledge development
        How do you do it?
        Self assessment vs testing?
        How do we support all trainees to make good progress with their computing SKD. 

This is a rough agenda which we will add timings to nearer the time. 

We really hope you can join us to come together for this discussion and if there's anything else you would like to add to the agenda for this meeting or others in the future please drop us an email!
