Constructivism, discovery, collaboration (1.5 Hours)
----------------------------------------------------

Discussion about

ITT CCF 4.6
> Questioning is an essential tool for teachers; questions can be used for many purposes, including to check pupils’ prior knowledge, assess understanding and break down problems.

TASK: Find out ... (10min) Async
Explore the concept of "constructivism", what is it?


TASK: Activity Concept (15 min) Async
* Previously you have considered leading knowledge transfer to the class (e.g. our small microteaching experiment)

With this new knowledge about constructivism we are to:
* Construct a possible concepts for a Computing based activities that could be considered constructivist/discovery/collaborative based
    * What would we need to prepare in advance?
        * resources? Scaffolds?
    * How would you define a task/goal?
    * EXTENSION (for the advanced): How would use assess them? what would the criteria be?

TASK: (Overall 15min? to 30min?)
* Consider Solo 5-10min
* Consider Pairs 5-10min
* Consider Class 5-10min

<details>

Pretty hard right
How can a young person build understanding of something when they have very little pre-requisite knowledge

You can use these techniques to consolidate/practice, but to generate the initial learning concepts??!?

### Description

Learning is viewed as something that happens in the mind of each learner.

> Constructivism is a view of learning based on the belief that knowledge isn't a thing that can be simply given by the teacher at the front of the room to students in their desks. 
> Rather, knowledge is constructed by learners through an active, mental process of development; 
> learners are the builders and creators of meaning and knowledge

> Each time one prematurely teaches a child something he could have discovered for himself, that child is kept from inventing it and consequently from understanding it completely. 
<sub>(Klahr & Nigam, 2004)</sub>

Constructivist theory, based on the work of Dewey (1938); Piaget (1950) and Bruner (1996) suggests that learning is a cumulative and active process during which the student constructs knowledge and meaning for themselves as they learn, connecting with, and explaining new knowledge in terms of, what they already know

Working with tangible real world objects is a central tenet of Papert’s constructionism (Papert and Harel 1991)

        * > Piaget was highly critical of teacher-directed instruction believing that teachers who take control of the child’s learning place the child into a passive role (Crain, 2005)
        * > Vygotsky did not believe children could reach a higher cognitive level without instruction from more learned individuals

    * > (Piaget) opinion was that offering education to children who are not yet ready for it was pointless. 
      > But that doesn’t equate to not offering them anything at all.
    * > up until 2019 there is still no evidence that the teacher who takes a step back and puts the control of learning in the hands of the student is more effective and efficient than the teacher who provides explicit instruction
    * > it is generally accepted that the transmission of our cumulative culture to future generations is what makes man as a species
* (Tangentially interesting and somewhat related to constructivism) [I would never send my kids to school](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/I_would_never_send_my_kids_to_school) Piotr Wozniak 2017

### Competency Based Curriculum

* [Teaching and learning in a competence-based curriculum: the case of four secondary schools in England](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09585176.2012.731008?src=recsys&journalCode=rcjo20) Byrne 2013
    * Loss of subject base identity
        * lack of confidence made practitioners less creative
    * Non expert teaching
    * lack of student autonomy - behaviour

* CBIC (my case study) - Competency Based Integrated Curriculum - 2009
    * (I can tell this story in our session)


### Discovery Based Learning

* [Discovery learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_learning#Assisted_vs._unassisted_discovery)
    * > is a technique of inquiry-based learning and is considered a constructivist based approach to education.
      > It is also referred to as problem-based learning, experiential learning and 21st century learning.
    * > A critical success factor to discovery learning is that it must be teacher assisted.
    * > Research shows that cognitive demands required for discovery in young children may hinder learning as they have limited amounts of existing knowledge to integrate additional information.
    * > Beginning learners do not have the necessary skills to integrate the new information with information they have learned in the past.
    * > Pure unassisted discovery should be eliminated due to the lack of evidence that it improves learning outcomes.
    * > The teachers’ role in discovery learning is therefore critical to the success of learning outcomes.

### Collaborative Learning

* EEF [Collaborative Learning](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evidence-summaries/teaching-learning-toolkit/collaborative-learning/)
    * > A collaborative (or cooperative) learning approach involves pupils working together on activities or learning tasks in a group small enough for everyone to participate on a collective task that has been clearly assigned.
    * > Pupils need support and practice to work together; it does not happen automatically.
    * > Tasks need to be designed carefully so that working together is effective and efficient, otherwise some pupils will try to work on their own.
    * > overemphasis on competition can cause learners to focus on winning rather than succeeding in their learning.

Aggerholm, Standal and Hordvik
low level competition in pe can provide students with meaningful positive experiences. (small groups)
Give _option_ for competition gives sense of ownership of their leaning

### Consider the phrase 'Asking not telling'

(Some notes I had and left them here)

* What does this code do?
* How would we find out what it does?
    * Run it?
* How does it work?
    * Dry run it?
    * More debug output?
* How would we modify it to (new thing)?
    * Slightly different values
* What additions could we make?
* How can we make those additions?


Counterpoint

Direct Instruction
------------------

(After understanding what constructivism is I suggest reading "Constructivism is not a pedagogy" by David Daidu as this is an excellent counterpoint)
