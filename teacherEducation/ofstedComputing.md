Ofsted Computing
================

* Ofsted [Research review series: computing](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/research-review-series-computing/research-review-series-computing) May 2022

* Insufficient curriculum time
    * > The 2017 report by the Royal Society highlighted that 1 hour a week of computing teaching was not adequate to teach the key stage 3 curriculum
        * down to 45min average by 2017
* Girls
    * 21% GCSE and 15% A-Level
    * Boring, lacked interest, confidence
    * > by Year 9, there was a large gender divide in the subject, with less than half the number of girls finding the subject interesting compared with boys
* Workforce
    * 36% of Computing teachers have post A-Level subject qualification
    * > the drop-out rate for teachers in ITT is higher in computing than in most other subjects
* Curriculum
    * Computer Science, ICT, Digital Literacy
    * > some subject content only exists at the interplay between these 3 pillars

| Form of knowledge | Computer science | Information technology | Digital literacy |
|-|-|-|-|
| Declarative 	| Programming syntax | 	Principles of effective multimedia design | Features of unreliable content |
|               | The purpose and function of different logic gates | Spreadsheet formulae |
| | knowledge of suitable data types  and structures | knowledge of appropriate font sizes and styles | knowledge of suitable key words to use when performing searches | 
|Procedural | Performing binary addition | Setting up a slide master | How to perform an advanced web search |
|           | Implementing a repeat in a programming language | Applying conditional formatting |


> ... the lab work of computer science: it motivates, illuminates, and brings to life the dry bones of theory. Without programming, computer science would be a dry, theoretical husk of a subject. Imagine a music lesson where the students only studied the rules of counterpoint or the structure of sonata form, but never brought them to life by performing or composing such music!

> (Students) fail to understand the #notional-machine they are learning to control

National Curriculum
* > use logical reasoning to predict the behaviour of simple programs

Block based languages encourage learners to avoid the most important structures: conditional execution and bounded loops

### Computational Thinking

> Denning point out that we should be cautious about the scope of CT and avoid exaggerated claims that it develops problem-solving skills that are transferrable to other domains.

Computational Thinking
> ‘approach to solving problems in a way that can be implemented with a computer


> problem-solving skill, derives primarily from the accumulation of a large store of domain-specific knowledge stored in long-term memory’

Information Technology
----------------------

Digital Literacy
----------------

Students digital competence is less than you think

> many pupils do not fully consider the reliability of a source and will usually consider it in terms of relevance and personal interest.

Sequencing
----------

Semantic wave - abstract - unpack meanings -  practical - repack meaning - abstract


Cross Curricular
----------------

Can't be done by non specialists

cross-curricular integration of similar subjects, such as ICT, was ineffective and put these subjects in a vague place in the curriculum.

Pedagogy
========

* > the subject content places great demands on a pupil’s short-term memory
* > unguided approaches are not appropriate for novices
* > activities should be used to develop expertise and not be seen as simplified versions of expert practice.
* Worked examples have more value to novices - remove them over time (curriculum sequence)
* Explicitly Label sub-goals (sub-goals help focus on abstract knowledge)
    * Less useful for more advanced students

### Unplugged
* > when choosing unplugged activities, teachers should pay careful attention to how the activity will contribute to achieving curriculum goals
* (unplugged) might introduce misconceptions and be ambiguous. Real algorithms are precise procedures (unambiguous)
* useful when introducing new knowledge

### Storytelling

* Psychologists refer to stories as ‘psychologically privileged’ (organised differently in memory)
    * 'Cat in the hat' recursion
* (stories) should be linked back to the specific computing concept (sematic waves)

Assessment
==========

* > ‘urgent need’ for a better understanding of formative assessment in computing that focuses on the building blocks of knowledge or assessment that targets misconceptions
* Concept Inventories as an assessment tool
* Consider careful _distractors_. These can make problems needlessly difficult
* > focuses on the knowledge and skills identified in the curriculum and not generic competencies

Systems
=======

### Infrastructure
* > features of school infrastructure as one of the main barriers to effective teaching of computing and likened this issue to the impact of ‘overzealous implementation’ of health and safety rules on school field trips and science experiments
