    * Area of the investigation - Keep this quite broad
    * Key reading related to the area - Outline at least three or four key texts that you have looked at for this. Ideally, this should include specific research articles
    * Focus of the area of enquiry/specific research question - What is the precise question or key issue that you wish to explore? Can you phrase it as a research question?
    * Possible ethical issues - The key ethical issues are informed consent, protection of children, anonymity and confidentiality, and payment of research participants. In the case of a literature review, as you are only using secondary data and that there are no participants involved, ethical clearance is not required. However, it is good practice to make a general statement to show that you have considered ethics in light of the research you are carrying out.
