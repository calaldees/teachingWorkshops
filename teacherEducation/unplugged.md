CS Unplugged
============

* Teachers' Standards
    * > 4.2 promote a love of learning and children’s intellectual curiosity
    * > 4.5 contribute to the design and provision of an engaging curriculum within the relevant subject area(s)
* Core content Framework
    * 5.) Adapt teaching
        * A variety of different ways

page 36 VIDEOS TO INSPIRE - A new video series from the CAS team shows us how young people can learn computing skills from everyday activities — without the need for a computer

Summary
-------

My ultra summary: good for manifesting engagement and understanding - activities should be paired with code-implementation/practical to be truly effective

* [[ofstedComputing]]
    * > when choosing unplugged activities, teachers should pay careful attention to how the activity will contribute to achieving curriculum goals
    * (unplugged) might introduce misconceptions and be ambiguous. Real algorithms are precise procedures (unambiguous)
    * useful when introducing new knowledge

Computational Thinking has no definition - so it can't be measured


Explore Unplugged Computer Science Activities (2 Hours)
----------------------------------------------

Async 1 hour 30 min + Group 30min == 2 hours

* Many aspects of computing can be taught without a computer.
* Watch the following trailer video
    * [Computer Science Unplugged trailer](https://youtu.be/KOYy4kyLEHs) 3min
* This adds an extra dimension of excitement and intrigue. Magic tricks can form discussion points. These physical activities are memorable and powerful.
* There are lots of resources out there. The trick is YOU knowing what's out their and digesting the activities so that you can run them.
    * As a group we can explore 10hours+ of reading/exploring and share it with the group

TASK:
* Goal: To have 3 activities that you could in the future run for a class with 0min notice.
    * e.g.
        * The network is down
        * There is a power cut
        * You are asked to cover another teachers lesson and no work has been set
        * You are asked to give a 1 hour workshop to a group of visiting primary students in the school hall
        * It's the last day of term and students are not particularly focused and want to do something different
    * Consider having the various printouts you would need to have ready _on standby_ in your classroom
        * I know in covid times some of these activities may not be appropriate, but it wont be this way forever!

1. (individual) Explore a range of CS Unplugged activities (1 hour 30 min) - consider 3 activities
    * Put links to the actives that you have settled on in Google Doc
2. (group) Describe one of the activities your explored to the group (30 min)
    * explain: 
        * what age/ability group it might be for?
        * what resources (props, printouts, space) you would need?
        * how much time?

        * There is the same volume/height of man in both

        * In 13 man mode - everyone is shorter (looses a feature eyes, nose, etc) - 2 of them have bits clipped completely (man 1 and man 6) - the split line moves up and down (if you measure it) - man 6 could be considered the extra guy 'because' he does not match to another body/part

    * Sequence of precise instructions - sort into suite:numerical - cut (any number of times)
    * 7,8,9,10 always in order
    * investigate why - put in visible linear order (see what happens to data) - any cut will mean that when placed at the other end, it is ALWAYS 4 numbers away from the same number. We don't know what quadrant will be which number, but they will always follow the say rotation of 4 because we are never breaking the chain of 4.
* [Assessing Computational Thinking in CS Unplugged Activities](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3017680.3017779) 2017
    * > Computer Science (CS) Unplugged activities have been deployed in many informal settings to present computing concepts in an engaging manner. To justify use in the classroom, however, it is critical for activities to have a strong educational component. For the past three years, we have been developing and refining a CS Unplugged curriculum for use in middle school classrooms. In this paper, we describe an assessment that maps questions from a comprehensive project to computational thinking (CT) skills and Bloom's Taxonomy. We present results from two different deployments and discuss limitations and implications of our approach.
    * 5 Unplugged activities - repeated again in two different context so students could not 'remember' the solution.
        * Character Encoding, Binary Search, Minimum Spanning tree (Muddy city), Finite State Automata, Binary Numbers
    * Assessment via outcome Proficient, Partially Proficient, and Unsatisfactory
    * Used for 50min lessons (for american middle school -> ks3)

Some ideas and consolidating thoughts

Criticality
-----------

* [A critical review of literature on “unplugged” pedagogies in K-12 computer science and computational thinking education](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08993408.2020.1789411) 2020
    * Criticality - two studies that cite unplugged differently
        * > teachers perceived that students were most excited by learning through creating, which included programming, game design, mobile app development, and physical computing. In other words, activities using high-tech computing devices were thought to generate more interest in computing than low-tech and unplugged approaches (Black et al., 2013). 
        *  > In contrast, another survey in 2014 of 300 primary and secondary computing teachers in the U.K. revealed that unplugged strategies were the most commonly reported in free-form responses on pedagogy (Sentance & Csizmadia, 2017).
    *  > Studies that tried to evaluate whether unplugged activities can develop CT suffer from both difficulties defining and measuring CT, as well as separating out the effect of these activities from other approaches (e.g. teaching programming)

Assembly Idea? - The power of code/automation
---------------------------------------------

* Each student given unique sudoku problem (batch generated by code)
* Explain the rules of sudoku
* I will write some code to solve sudoku - while the class/assembly solves the paper problems
* 30 Mortals vs 1 'Computer + Programmer' - play the _Mortal Kombat_ soundtrack
* [hackertyper.net](https://hackertyper.net/) - fun hacker stereotype simulator in a webbrowser - each keypress types 3 characters from a random linux source file
    * You can upload your own file
* Get the program to list and solve every problem that was given to the room (in realtime)
    * If you do A-Level computing, I will explain this code to you

With code: One person on the planet solve the problem 'once' and it's solved forever

> The pen is mightier than the sword.
> A computer may be mightier than the pen.

* If you could use a computer properly - if you could code ... 
* you could use it for incredible personal gain, maximise output, control information
* or 
* you could use it to empower people, grow community's, foster collaboration and share the expanded capabilities/solutions with humanity
* The choice is yours, but only if you know how to use the tool
* Otherwise ... you don't get a choice, you'll be solving somebody else's (possibly meaningless) sudokus
