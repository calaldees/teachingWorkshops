KSQ 4: What is education?

Next week: KSQ 5: How do children learn?

* Previous Tasks:
    * Can you acquire the department SOW and subject curriculum overview for KS3 (we will be talking about schemes of work and lesson planning next session SP4)


Session Goal (from session overview)
------------

(It's a big list ...)

* What, and how, has teaching and learning of subject been affected in this area/my placement school?
* What are current subject practices?
* What are the skills of reasoning and problem solving in Computer Science and how are computing departments addressing these? (KS3/KS4/KS5)
* Planning for progression - Schemes of Work - Building schemata
    * Pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models
* Exploring strategies that aid teaching and learning including contextualised, independent, discovery
* Making effective use of a lesson plan
* Planning to aid learning in Computing
    * School’s curriculum materials inform lesson preparation
    * coherent wider vision for successful learning

### Moved to another session
* Introduction to PRIMM pedagogy


### Objectives In Summary

* Look at Scheme's of Work and understand how progression is planned for (2 hours?)
* Study a range of existing lessons (2 hours?)
* Attempt to plan your own lesson (deliberately had at this stage) (2 hours?)


Official Guidance
-----------------

(I found this hard to identify some of these)

Teachers' standards
* > 4.5 contribute to the design and provision of an engaging curriculum within the relevant subject area(s).

ITT CCF

* > 3.7 In all subject areas, pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (or “schemata”); carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important.

* > 4.2 Effective teachers introduce new material in steps, explicitly linking new ideas to what has been previously studied and learned. 

* > 5.4 Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils.  

Reminders
---------

* We need to elect a subject rep (by end of this session)
* Subject knowledge audit completed + consent form + questionnaire
    * In ePortfolio (I need to audit these are present)
    * [Consent form](https://github.com/ComputingTeachers/subjectKnowledge/blob/main/_evaluation.md) - only 1 so far
    * [Questionnaire](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=2rIgA90iq02MIW5kS6FPE4bZosdBzY5AvRurHpjUivVURjROUExKR1VVVlU3UlJOUURIOFIxUTdFVS4u) - only 3 so far



Overview
--------

* Weekley reflections and pair collaboration (30min)
    * Normally  20min (10min each) - but adding bonus task
    * What are the differences between your schools? (as many things as you can identify)
* [planning.md](./planning.md) (3 hours)
    * SOW
    * Textbooks
    * Shape tools
    * Context
* [plan-lesson.md](./plan-lesson.md) (1.5 hours) workshop
* Action points and reflection (15min)

Next week
---------
* [Subject Pedagogy Research Proposal: Microsoft Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=2rIgA90iq02MIW5kS6FPE4bZosdBzY5AvRurHpjUivVUQ0JRMFNOREUwNlBTVkxLREQ5UDFQVDVaRC4u)


### Computing Pedagogy - Reading ideas

* [Hello World — Issue 0](https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/issues/0) Sep 2021
* [CAS - Computing in the national curriculum - A guide for secondary teachers](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk/data/uploads/cas_secondary.pdf)
    * Skim this document - It's the CAS overview of delivering Computing
* [Computing in the curriculum: Challenges and strategies from a teacher’s perspective](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-016-9482-0) 2016 Sue Sentance and Andrew Csizmadia
    * (Quick note about - research sample methods and codification)
    * Asked 300 active Computing teachers how they recommend teaching the subject
    * Questions asked
        1. What good techniques/strategies have you found for helping students to understand programming?
        2. Please describe any good techniques/strategies you use for helping students to understand other aspects of Computing?
        3. What difficulties, if any, have you experienced teaching programming?
        4. What difficulties, if any, have you experienced teaching other aspects of Computing
    * Five key themes
        * unplugged type activities
        * contextualisation of tasks
        * collaborative learning
        * developing computational thinking
        * scaffolding programming tasks
