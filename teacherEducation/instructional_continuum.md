    1. Copy code: students are given step-by-step instructions to follow, e.g. copy an example program;
    2. Targeted tasks: students are given a short task, e.g. fix buggy code, Parsons problems;
    3. Shared coding: the teacher thinks aloud as they design and write code, sometimes called demonstrating or live coding, e.g. teacher models how to write a program;
    4. Project-based: students are provided with a project goal and create a solution, e.g.create a quiz in Scratch;
    5. Inquiry-based: students consider a scenario or question and create a solution, e.g. explore a set of code commands and discover ways to use them;
    6. Tinkering: completely unstructured student-led exploration, e.g. explore a software”

    * encourage students to become more active in their learning, 
    * make the CS classroom more authentic, more similar to the real work setting of CS practitioners
    * build on students' existing knowledge and understanding
    * encourage peer learning in various ways. In all papers, ICT is used to leverage these efforts.
    * > bring about a transformation in the students' professional point of view: Helping them become competent and appreciative of what CS professionals deem as problems worth solving, acceptable work process, elegant and effective solutions, knowledge worth knowing, and so forth

    * Problem Based Learning (PBL)
    * > Without experiencing the process of experimenting with possible solutions and pursuing paths to determine if they are fruitful or not, students will not be able to become self-sufficient problem solvers. 
    * > But the focus on independent solving and student-directed exploration encouraged in PBL can lead to novice students feeling overwhelmed by the degree of flexibility they have been permitted (Kay et al., 2000).
    * > Given the centrality of problem-solving to all academic endeavors, and to the entire breadth of a computer science curriculum, it seems unrealistic to expect students to achieve a high level of proficiency during a single course, particularly given the modest initial starting point of many new college students. 
    * > a problem-based curriculum is likely to be most effective as a conscious effort on the part of an entire department, where the additional workload will be recognized and supported
    * > design an interdisciplinary computing major that integrates strongly with the liberal arts tradition
