    * early-career-framework [Core induction programme](https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/)

### Your choice of language

* This shapes how you think about yourself and your relationship with others.
* Some thoughts
    * Children (<10?)
    * Kids?
    * Young People
    * "Low _ability_" !!!?!!
        * "Low attainment"
    * (Verbal) You _Just_, _Simply_ (Don't trivialise)
* Action Point
    * Listen to the language the professionals use around you
    * Make notes on phrases you hear

### Judging other teachers

* You simply do not know enough about the role to make a judgement on other teachers
* Bite your tongue
* The education you observe WILL be different from your personal experience of education. You are a sample-size of 
    * There are millions of different classrooms. You don't know.

### Be a _net positive_

* Your presence in a school as a trainee will drain a lot of time and energy from the other staff. 
* Be mindful of them
* Consider how you can reduce how much you take and maximise how much you contribute

### Professionalism

See my Session on [_firstProfetionalRole.md](./_firstProfetionalRole.md)

#### Recommendations
* Be punctual
* Do not discuss politics or religion with school colleagues
* Be 100% yourself, but watch your terminology/language
* Be mindful of ongoing negativity
    * when relaying problems - suggest solutions
    * identify/call-out good progress


### Transport to placements

* Public transport (+ folding bike)?
* Contact other students that are going to that school
    * TODO: Can CCCU assist by facilitating students contact at the same school?
* On arrival at school: contact other staff from your area
* Invest in transport Motorbike/Car
* Worst case: Rent B&B or other accommodation during the week.

<sub>sidenote: we have no schools accepting Computing placements in Canterbury. One possibility if the conduct of previous PGCE students. Your relationship with your school has a wider impact than just you.</sub>




### Subject Sessions

* Thursday Evening (online)
    * EP/GP
* Friday (on campus)
    * Subject Pedagogy




### My Role

* QA Mentors
    * NOT assess you teach
* Support you - PAT
* Mark academic assignments
* Assess folders at end
* PGCE
    * Write your reference
    * Mark your ePortfolios
* SD
    * Final assessment

### My Role as course tutor (the reality)

* My goal is to support you become a successful teacher.
* I will do everything I can to help you _succeed_.
* Some of the things I do you may not _like_, but they are to help you be successful.


* I will keep records of our interactions
* Student Charter
* support action plan
    * Professional communication (to me or between each other)
        * > 8.3 ... supporting and developing effective professional relationships with colleagues.
    * Attendance (inform ahead and report formally after)
        * Unless you have been incapacitated please communicate in advance
        * Attending punctually is the expectation for someone who is training to "have the legal responsibility to supervise 30 young people at 8:45am each morning"

* PGCE Mark final folder (or SD Final assessment panel) + Assignment (Not SD) + Reference (Not SD)

* I'm kind of your line manager
* BUT you hold all the power
    * You fill in the exit survey

### Peer Communication

* Previous years:
    *  The Computing groups were supportive to each other. They had a WhatsApp group and formed a great peer support network and are still friends today.
* Last year:
    * was a cataclysmic clash of characters that antagonised each other and there was friction with "Who kicked Who from the group". Group work in sessions was limited. 
    * This was a difficult year for everyone.
* This year:
    * When you communicate with each other you communicate as professionals. Do not expect everyone to be _your friend_
    * You can setup informal communications between each other on the expectation that you can function like professionals in our subject sessions
    * I will raise professional communication issues with you formally and quickly.


* To Jest and highlight the differences
    * DOTA, Fortnight, I'm so Woke, YOLO, Such a beta simp
    * Mortgage, Car, I have knowledge far beyond your comprehension as I have a child and have achieved true enlightenment.


### Notes about tooling

* Do not suffer dataloss.
    * Use the right tools.
    * There will be little excuse for you as Computing professionals to loose data.
    * Dropbox, OneDrive, GoogleDrive, Google Docs, Microsoft Office 365

* Use Styles
    * If I ever see anyone changing the size of a font freehand in a document or slideshow, I will loose my ****!


### Recording Sessions

* Session recordings
    * If we record a 7 hour video
        * This is hard to access/find/seek information
        * It discourages some people to participate because it will be set in stone
    * I will record segments of sessions
* The _YouTube_ effect - the bar of _Professional Content Creators_
    * We are all exposed to exceptionally high quality online videos
        * Pro video equipment, lighting, editing, scripting, info-graphics
* Our videos from our session are not designed to be online _professional content_. They are reminders for us.
* In reality - it is hard to extract meaningful information from a video



### Handling the tidal-wave of Communication

* Setup email rules
* Setup account as a _forwarding account_?

* Complaints in the past that communication has been fragmented, late or mistimed
* Lots of moving parts
    * Tutor, School Mentor, Uni Admin, Uni Program Directors, Other Students, School Admin, Enhancing Pedagogy Tutor
* I am not on the same email lists as you (This is being discussed/rectified)
* If the global communication you receive is less then ideal ...
    * Do not panic - calm down!
    * Communicate concerns clearly to you PAT
    * You will not be penalised un-duely or unfairly

#### Proposed solution: Group Wiki

* Take group responsibility for organising your important information
* By pro-actively managing this you will be much more aware of the important information


### Your schools?

Have you been informed about "meet the mentor"?
