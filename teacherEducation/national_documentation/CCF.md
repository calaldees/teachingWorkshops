## How Pupils Learn (Standard 2 – ‘Promote good progress’)

### Learn that
1. Learning involves a lasting change in pupils’ capabilities or understanding. #2-HowLearn-Learn-that-1-learning_is_lasting
2. Prior knowledge plays an important role in how pupils learn; committing some key facts to their long-term memory is likely to help pupils learn more complex ideas.  #2-HowLearn-Learn-that-2-prior_knowledge_identified
3. An important factor in learning is memory, which can be thought of as comprising two elements: working memory and long-term memory. 
4. Working memory is where information that is being actively processed is held, but its capacity is limited and can be overloaded. #2-HowLearn-Learn-that-4-working_memory
5. Long-term memory can be considered as a store of knowledge that changes as pupils learn by integrating new ideas with existing knowledge. #2-HowLearn-Learn-that-5-long_term_memory
6. Where prior knowledge is weak, pupils are more likely to develop misconceptions, particularly if new ideas are introduced too quickly. #2-HowLearn-Learn-that-6-misconceptions
7. Regular purposeful practice of what has previously been taught can help consolidate material and help pupils remember what they have learned. #2-HowLearn-Learn-that-7-regular_practice
8. Requiring pupils to retrieve information from memory, and spacing practice so that pupils revisit ideas after a gap are also likely to strengthen recall. #2-HowLearn-Learn-that-8-spaced_retrieval

5. Explicitly teaching pupils the knowledge and skills they need to succeed within particular subject areas is beneficial. #3-SubjCur-Learn-that-5-explicit_instruction
6. In order for pupils to think critically, they must have a secure understanding of knowledge within the subject area they are being asked to think critically about. #3-SubjCur-Learn-that-6-criticality_requires_knowledge
7. In all subject areas, pupils learn new ideas by linking those ideas to existing knowledge, organising this knowledge into increasingly complex mental models (or “schemata”); carefully sequencing teaching to facilitate this process is important. #3-SubjCur-Learn-that-7-link_schemata
8. Pupils are likely to struggle to transfer what has been learnt in one discipline to a new or unfamiliar context. #3-SubjCur-Learn-that-8-discipline_transfer_context
9. To access the curriculum, early literacy provides fundamental knowledge; reading comprises two elements: word reading and language comprehension; systematic synthetic phonics is the most effective approach for teaching pupils to decode. #3-SubjCur-Learn-that-9-literacy_terminology_vocabulary
10. Every teacher can improve pupils’ literacy, including by explicitly teaching reading, writing and oral language skills specific to individual disciplines  #3-SubjCur-Learn-that-10-responsibility_for_literacy

## Assessment (Standard 6 – ‘Make accurate and productive use of assessment’)

### Learn that
1. Effective assessment is critical to teaching because it provides teachers with information about pupils’ understanding and needs.
2. Good assessment helps teachers avoid being over-influenced by potentially misleading factors, such as how busy pupils appear.
3. Before using any assessment, teachers should be clear about the decision it will be used to support and be able to justify its use. 
4. To be of value, teachers use information from assessments to inform the decisions they make; in turn, pupils must be able to act on feedback for it to have an effect.
5. High-quality feedback can be written or verbal; it is likely to be accurate and clear, encourage further effort, and provide specific guidance on how to improve.
6. Over time, feedback should support pupils to monitor and regulate their own learning.
7. Working with colleagues to identify efficient approaches to assessment is important; assessment can become onerous and have a disproportionate impact on workload.

### Learn how to

1. Avoid common assessment pitfalls, by:
    1. Discussing and analysing with expert colleagues how to plan formative assessment tasks linked to lesson objectives and think ahead about what would indicate understanding (e.g. by using hinge questions to pinpoint knowledge gaps).

## Managing Behaviour (Standard 7 – ‘Manage behaviour effectively’)

### Learn that
1. Establishing and reinforcing routines, including through positive reinforcement, can help create an effective learning environment.
2. A predictable and secure environment benefits all pupils, but is particularly valuable for pupils with special educational needs.
3. The ability to self-regulate one’s emotions affects pupils’ ability to learn, success in school and future lives.
4. Teachers can influence pupils’ resilience and beliefs about their ability to succeed, by ensuring all pupils have the opportunity to experience meaningful success.
5. Building effective relationships is easier when pupils believe that their feelings will be considered and understood.
6. Pupils are motivated by intrinsic factors (related to their identity and values) and extrinsic factors (related to reward).
7. Pupils’ investment in learning is also driven by their prior experiences and perceptions of success and failure.
