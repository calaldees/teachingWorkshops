The 2024 Quality Requirements at CCCU
====================================

Key features of our successful bid to deliver the 2024 quality requirements

## Developmental stages: Emerging, Establishing and Embedding

|Stage | By the end of the stage | CCF Core Area Focus|
|-|-|-|
|1: Emerging | Trainees understand themselves as education professionals and their pupils as learners | Behaviour management, pedagogy and professional behaviours|
|2: Establishing | Trainees deploy their knowledge and skills of effective teaching so that pupils make good progress | Curriculum and assessment.|
|3: Embedding | Trainees embed their professional autonomy and collaborative practice through critically evaluating and improving their teaching and pupils’ learning | All revisited|


| | | UBT | ITP | GPP|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Stage 1 (Emerging) | Sept – Oct  | 5 days | 10 days | 10 days (induction)|
|Stage 2 (Establishing) | Nov – March  | 16 days | 10 days | 44 days (up to 60% contact)|
|Stage 3 (Embedding) | April – July  | 10 days | 5 days | 66 days (40+ at 80% contact)|
|Total | 177 days/36 weeks | 31 days | 25 days | 120 days|


## Deep integration of university placement

* Universal agreement on learning outcomes
* Course planning starts from placement-based learning
* All content integrated across three main elements: 
    * university-based teaching (UBT)
    * intensive training and practice (ITP)
    * general placement practice (GPP)


## Intensive training and practice (ITP) 

* Intensive training and practice (ITP) led by lead mentors (probably university-based)
* Can be in placement setting, university, or hybrid
* Coaching model of delivery:
    * Group coaching (stages 1 & 2)
    * Bespoke one-to-one/small group/peer coaching (stage 3)
* Content follows foundational content on curriculum map 
* Learning activities include: coaching, micro-teaching, structured observation and directed tasks through which to develop trainee practice and critical reflection; use video technologies



## Other key pedagogical elements
* Threshold concepts are assessed expected outcomes. They appear on the curriculum map where the element is secured (rather than where first encountered) and are introduced, revisited, established and embedded iteratively to ensure full coverage of the CCF. 
* Consistent pedagogical approaches used at every stage include collaborative work with peers; independent study; coaching by lead mentors; mentoring 
* Materials join up content across university, placement and ITP (e.g. theory in university followed by narrated observation, trainee observe expert using grid, collaboratively plan, video and critique practice)
* Experts work collaboratively across university and placements, will all be outstanding classroom practitioners with deep critical understanding of best available evidence/research
* Theoretical Frameworks & research with a narrow range of simpler frameworks in early stages and more challenging, complex theoretical perspectives at later stages 


## Some notes about our submission
* We had to select one course to focus on. Our main ITE courses are primary undergraduate, primary postgraduate and secondary postgraduate. Overlapping with the others, we chose primary PGCE as the most representative of our offer. 
* There is no expectation or requirement for primary and secondary, undergraduate and postgraduate to be the same. We will look to have a consistent approach to key elements that it will enhance trainees’ experience and outcomes, support staff wellbeing and is appropriate to the phase and course. 

## Terminology introduced by the DfE
| | |
|-|-|
|Lead Mentor: |A key role in delivering elements of the course, supporting trainee progress and ensuring integration. May be university or school based.|
|Trainee: |We used this term in our submission to mirror the DfE’s language|
|ITP: |Intensive Training and Practice is a key component of the new criteria and a major change.|
|Curriculum map: |A summary of how we sequence the curriculum and integrate all elements|
