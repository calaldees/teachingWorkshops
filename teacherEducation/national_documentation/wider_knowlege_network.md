Wider
=====

> I regularly ensure pupils have relevant domain-specific knowledge and think critically by participating in wider networks

* Twitter (cpd)
* feeder primaries (cpd)
* NCCE (networking and subject certificates)
* Profetional mentors
* Domain specific knowledge
    * Recent events?
    * National days (safer internet day?)

* in mentor training - how are they doing this? How do we share this?
