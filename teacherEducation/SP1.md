Introductions
-------------

### Who am I?

My background
* 7 years teaching ICT and Computing in secondary schools - Practical battle experience
* 10 years as a senior developer in central London across a range of domains
* (2 years sessions) + 2 year formally as Lecturer in Education. (You are my 5th cohort)
* I will be constantly upskilling this for the rest of my career

I have my own ideas about how to teach computing
* Multiple languages at once
* Freedom (self direct-ish)/project based/Creativity (removal of hierarchy)
* Unit tests, Pair programming (talking about code and collaborating), Version control
But this course is not about my _opinions_ or about my preferred teaching methods.
You must develop your own critically to develop your own subject pedagogy knowledge.

### Who are you?

TASK: 120 second summary
* Rough background (education, work)
* Course: PGCE, 7-14 or SchoolDirect?
* What are you exited about this year
* What are you fearful about this year (we are all vulnerable)

The burden of learning to teach - the _expert beginner_
Primary->Secondary->Uni->Career1Employment1->Career1Employment2->Retraining->Career2Employment1

### Quick Thumb-up-o-meter

* Multiple languages?
* Version control?
* Linux?

### You will outgrow my support

* Right now I might look to you like some super-human teaching deity. 
* By the end of this course you will feel completely differently. 
* I'm just some dude doing a job like you. 
* By the end of this year you will have outgrown the support I can give you. 
* At the celebration day at the end of the course we will just be a bunch of professionals sitting around and talking about education.
