Summative Assessment in Computer Science
It is worth becoming familiar with the assessment strategies used at different levels of computer science

* KS3
    * [CAS Progression Pathways](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk/data/quick_start_secondary/progression_path.pdf)
        * [Computing Progression Pathways Guidance](https://magpie.education/computing_faq7b.html)
* GCSE
    * National GCSE debacle - Examined coursework was abolished at GCSE because of rampant plagiarism - GCSE is exam only

We will continue to look at classroom strategies for assessment in January


Questions
---------

These are questions to prompt your thinking.

* How do CAS progression pathways map to GCSE? do that map? What might be difficult/different in the ks3 to ks4 transition?
* Why was the non-exam assessment at GCSE abolished?
* What are the implications of ofqual saying "This affords exam boards the opportunity to be innovative in their approach to assessing programming skills" with it's computing reform
* Why does A-Level Computer science have a _practical exam_ and an assessed _project_ but the GCSE does not?
