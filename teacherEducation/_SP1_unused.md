Who are you teaching?
---------------------

* Your students are NOT you - stop using yourself as a benchmark
    * How you learned
    * your interests are not their interests "learn by making games; Who doesn't like games"
    * What % of your students will get a degree in Computing?
* "Please don't suggest _make a game_"
    * Female, ethnicity
    * PhD in Physics
    * Code bootcamp -> professional programmer
    * Looking for projects




### Know Thyself (15min)

* [Know Thyself](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:intro-exercises) Chapter 1 - Greg Wilson
    * What do you most want to teach?
    * Who do you most want to teach?
    * Why do you want to teach?
    * How will you know if you're teaching well?
    * What do you most want to learn about teaching and learning
    * What is one specific thing you believe about teaching and learning?

TASK: answer the questions above - save them safely - I will hear some of your points, but we are not going to debate them here - we will reflect on these at the end of the course



### Lighthouse statement

You've made a lighthouse statement about _who you are_ and _why you want to teach_.
I made a lighthouse statement at the start of my teacher training PGCE.
I read it back at the end of my PGCE year.
I could not identify with it.
It was some words that babaled about _making a difference_. It was unstructured idealist nonsense.
I could not believe how much the year had changed me.

This year will change you.

    * > Politicians, business leaders, and educators often say that people should learn to program because the jobs of the future will require it. 
      > However, as Benjamin Doxtdator pointed out, many of those claims are built on shaky ground. 
      > Even if they were true, education shouldnâ€™t prepare people for the jobs of the future: it should give them the power to decide what kinds of jobs there are and to ensure that those jobs are worth doing. And as Mark Guzdial points out, there are actually many reasons to learn how to program:

Why Learn to Program? (individual/20)
---------------------
* To understand our world.
* To study and understand processes.
* To be able to ask questions about the influences on their lives.
* To use an important new form of literacy.
* To have a new way to learn art, music, science, and mathematics.
* As a job skill.
* To use computers better.
* As a medium in which to learn problem-solving.

TASK: Complete the grid

* Which points are closely aligned in importance for you and your learners (i.e. on the diagonal in your grid)?
* Which points are misaligned (i.e. in the off-diagonal corners)?
* How should this affect what you teach?
