Progression Model (30min)
-----------------

Using
* [Statutory guidance - National curriculum in England: framework for key stages 1 to 4](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-framework-for-key-stages-1-to-4/the-national-curriculum-in-england-framework-for-key-stages-1-to-4) 2014
* [National Curriculum: computing programmes of study](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study) 2013
* [AQA GCSE Computer Science 8525](https://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/computer-science-and-it/gcse/computer-science-8525/subject-content) (Or the exam board used your school) (I chose this because it's web accessible rather than in cryptic inaccessible PDF docs)
* What would you put in your own curriculum if you were a head of department

1. Divide your board/page into 3: KS1-2, KS3, KS4
2. List the concepts required in each category
3. Draw lines that link these concepts (e.g. what skills is KS3 are pre-requisites/required for ks4)

(This is deliberately a very very hard task to get you to think about progression)
