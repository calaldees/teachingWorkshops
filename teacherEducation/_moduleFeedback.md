Module Feedback
========



30min session

Neutral answers are not helpful to us. But we can't coach them not to pick them. Explain how they cant be actioned

Feed forward 15min+
* 2 or 3 actions to improve the students experience of the module
* Agreed actions
    * > What would be a successful outcome of an action
    * > What would change disagrees to agrees in the next evaluation
* Don't assume shared understanding of anything
    * Double check

> Please some people fed back disagree

* Explain to students 'Covi' circle
    * Circle of control (the focus)
    * Circle of influence
    * Circle of Concern (no control or influence)

BlackBoard - what is on their circle of control or influence

Answer everything that has been said with another question

* Categorise 8 different ways of reacting to feedback

Speaksheet with dates for module evaluations/feedback


* > The main issue raised in evaluations was registration and access to Blackboard which was beyond your control
    * How clear were the instructions you were given?
    * Have these issues been resolved satisfactorily?
    * Was the alternate provision of Padlets effective for you?
    * > What would make this more effective for you?

> Sometimes they are not quite sure themselfs their was a problem - let alone how to solve it
* Acknowledge the sense of helplessness

NSS Qualitative coding for comments
* course level comms
* university level comms

University upgraded blackboard to help

If Feedback == All good
* can you give examples (would be good to capture this)

* Student with an axe to grind
    * Suggest a tutorial (outside of the scope - this is not your rodeo)
    * "its prejudice" (tutor hates me)
    * > Is this an issues affecting other?

* Student suggest changing the time of taught session, which is neither reasonable nor possible
    * Reasonable is subjective - who is saying this is not reasonable
    * > What might be lost starting at 10am?
    * Start earlier and finish earlier? (for mums that needs to leave early)
    * exploring question
    * stay within your ownership of control

TIME BOX THE MEETING ... dont let it turn into 2 hours

Depersonalise the feedback - not naming and shaming - focus on the process

> The group is unsettled as there was poor behaviour on the whatapp group last night. Only just happened, not evelaution, bit is is clearly a big issue right now
Professionalism - ongoing and worth address, then address it
