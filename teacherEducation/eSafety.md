        * > All staff should be aware that technology is a significant component in many safeguarding and wellbeing issues. 
        * > Children are at risk of abuse and other risks online as well as face to face. 
        * > In many cases abuse and other risks will take place concurrently both online and offline. 
        * > Children can also abuse other children online, this can take the form of abusive, harassing, and misogynistic/misandrist messages, the non-consensual sharing of indecent images, especially around chat groups, and the sharing of abusive images and pornography to those who do not want to receive such content

        * > Only appropriately trained professionals should attempt to make a diagnosis of a mental health problem. 
        * > Education staff, however, are well placed to observe children day-to-day and identify those whose behaviour suggests that they may be experiencing a mental health problem or be at risk of developing one.
    * Annex: Further information 
        * Cybercrime (pg25)
            * Cybercrime is criminal activity committed using computers and/or the internet. It is broadly categorised as either ‘cyber-enabled’ (crimes that can happen off-line but are enabled at scale and at speed on-line) or ‘cyber dependent’ (crimes that can be committed only by using a computer). Cyber-dependent crimes include: 
                * unauthorised access to computers (illegal ‘hacking’), for example accessing a school’s computer network to look for test paper answers or change grades awarded
                * ‘Denial of Service’ (Dos or DDoS) attacks or ‘booting’. These are attempts to make a computer, network or website unavailable by overwhelming it with internet traffic from multiple sources, and,
                * making, supplying or obtaining malware (malicious software) such as viruses, spyware, ransomware, botnets and Remote Access Trojans with the intent to commit further offence, including those above.
            * Children with particular skills and interest in computing and technology may inadvertently or deliberately stray into cyber-dependent crime.
            * If there are concerns about a child in this area, the designated safeguarding lead (or a deputy), should consider referring into the Cyber Choices programme. This is a nationwide police programme supported by the Home Office and led by the National Crime Agency, working with regional and local policing. It aims to intervene where young people are at risk of committing, or being drawn into, low-level cyber-dependent offences and divert them to a more positive use of their skills and interests.
            * Note that Cyber Choices does not currently cover ‘cyber-enabled’ crime such as fraud, purchasing of illegal drugs on-line and child sexual abuse and exploitation, nor other areas of concern such as on-line bullying or general on-line safety.
            * Additional advice can be found at:

                    * Loads of great links to resources and contacts
                    * > If your student has an interest in computers and technology, it could be valuable to encourage them to develop their skills as cyber industry professionals are in high demand. Those with a real interest in how tech works could have a bright future ahead. However, it’s important to have a discussion with them about using their skills legally and the consequences of becoming involved in cyber crime. Recognising and engaging with this interest may encourage them to follow the correct and legal pathway.
                    * > There are plenty of financially rewarding and legal careers available to them. These include coding, engineering, web development, penetration testing, security operations, law enforcement, legal hacking and many more roles in both the public and private sectors.
