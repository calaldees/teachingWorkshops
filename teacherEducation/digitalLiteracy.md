### Evaluating sources of information

Most of the education about digital literacy focus on information analysis.

The English curriculum doesn't mention the internet, source, digital or media.
'Assessing the quality of an information source' is now been moved into the realm of the Computing curriculum.
'attention to trustworthiness'

Access to information is not a problem any more - how to find and use it IS.
Regardless of subject, the skill is how to locate and use information.

> the main approach has been to provide students with checklists they can use to assess the credibility of individual websites. 
> However, the checklist approach is outdated. 
> It would be far better to teach young people to follow the lead of professional fact-checkers: When confronted by a new and unfamiliar website, they begin by looking elsewhere on the web, searching for any information that might shed light on who created the site in question and for what purpose.
