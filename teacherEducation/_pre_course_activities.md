Pre-Course Activities
=====================

An introduction to the PGCE Secondary/7-14/School Direct 
 Programme in Computer Science 2022-23

Dear Colleague,

Congratulations on being offered and having accepted a place to start on the PGCE/School Direct Computing programme in September.
Both programmes are very intensive and demanding, but are also a very enjoyable, stimulating and creative.
The more you can do before starting the programme, the easier it will be, especially in the first few weeks in September.

You may already have received some recommendations for action as part of your offer for your place.
The following points will support you in using the time from now until the start of the programme to full effect.

Please note this list is not a prescriptive list of what you must engage with before the course starts.
Rather, it is a list of activities that you might want to dip into to support your preparation for September.
You can do as much or as little from it as you like; I will not be judging you for it! After all, in the year ahead, you are not working for me, but for yourselves!

If you do engage with the activities, then you might want to collate some reflections about what you have learned from the reading/videos/apps
but, again, this is not a requirement.
It would however help you get into the habit of undertaking professional reflection which will be key to your success next year.


Visit a Secondary School
------------------------

* This cannot be mandated, but it is _highly_ recommended that you shadow a Computing teacher in a secondary school for at least a day.
* We can put you in touch with mentors from schools we work and assist you with setting up visits.
* Kent has a unique context because 50% of schools are grammar schools. It is advisable to visit both a grammar school and a non-selective school.


Enrol on NCCE CS Accelerator
------------

* Register for [NCCE courses](https://teachcomputing.org/courses)/CS-Accelerator-Programme 
* accrue a [bursary](https://teachcomputing.org/bursary) (for all trainee teachers)
* Build evidence for subject knowledge development for portfolio
* Understand what is on the curriculum

Your Computing Skills
---------------------

* As the course concentrates on teaching pedagogies, rather than spending time on improving your computing skills, you should take the opportunity ‘brush up’ your subject knowledge.
    * Once the course starts your time will be significantly limited
* You've all done a subject knowledge audit with your application. This document will be reworked before September. We will track your subject knowledge development.

Equipment
---------

Will you need a personal laptop? Possibly.

You will be put in a range of different environments at short notice.
* You may be mandated to use a school machine.
* You me be required to provide your own machine.
You should probably have a personal machine of some form ready-to-use in your back pocket.

Spec wise ... you will not need anything special.

Operating system should not matter to a Computing specialist. Use whatever you need to do the job you need.
E.g
* You could use Linux and use a VM or WINE for some Windows applications.
* You could use Windows and use Docker or WSL when you need nix based stuff
* Use OSx (again visualising when needed)

Few thoughts
* Your placement school will have limited resources
* A provided laptop will have a 'spin-up time' as you figure out how it is setup or perform your required setup yourself
* As a computer scientist you will need the ability to self manage your machine and install whatever crazy stuff you need. (A provided laptop may not have these rights)
* Every school is different
* Your personal device may not be covered by your insurance or the schools insurance
* Your personal device may not even be allowed to connect to a school network


Classroom Documentary
---------------------

* The Classroom Experiment: Professor Dylan Wiliam
    * In this two-part series, theory and practice meet head on as education expert Professor Dylan Wiliam sets up an experimental school classroom.
    * For one term, he takes over a Year 8 class at a secondary comprehensive to test simple ideas that he believes could improve the quality of our children's education.
    * Some of the higher ability students are not responding well to the new rule of No Hands Up in class, and Wiliam is worried they are at risk of being left behind.
    * There is a classroom revolt when the teachers remove grades from work.
    * The idea is to make the students actually read the comments on their work in order to help them improve, but they are left confused and angry after becoming so used to the traditional grading system.
    * By the end of term, however, even Wiliam is surprised by the impact the experiment has had on the students' academic achievement.
