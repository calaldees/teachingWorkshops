* Are not focused on subject knowledge but on subject pedagogy, and a broad spectrum of pedagogical practice
    * however much they make demands for ‘tips for teaching’ – our position is meta-pedagogy and androgogy to facilitate a greater ability to critically and creatively develop their own pedagogical judgement in the classroom
* That you include a range of viewpoints on the pedagogy, and pedagogies that might be contentious (I have bought myself a copy of ‘Teach like a champion’)
    * If we promote a narrow menu of pedagogies we make ourselves redundant to some and possibly set ourselves up to be redundant to our schools as well

Disclaimer
----------

All teaching is subjective. It is dependent on
* Your students
* Your environment (school/curriculum/community/country)
* You (you are not me)

Everything here is a suggestion and example of what has worked in some specific environments in the past.
It is NOT the gospel of how to teach Computing.

In teacher education you are assessed by your mentor who may have many years of experience and their own strategies for teaching.
Undermining or under valuing that experience will not go down well.

Always remember: We are training young people for a future we know nothing about.
The world will change during your career.

We are aiming for
* Autonomous learners
* Confident in their abilities
* Responsible citizens

Learners
--------

* Established/Mature mentored by younger
* Expert Novices

Pedagogy
--------

> pedagogy is ‘what one needs to know, and the skills one needs to command, in order to make and justify the many different kinds of decision of which teaching is constituted

 (Black and Wiliam, 2018)  Alexander (2008)
 

Evidence Informed Pedagogy
--------------------------

* [Evidence-informed pedagogy](https://impact.chartered.college/article/evidence-informed-pedagogy/) Impact - Chartered College of Teaching
    * > if we, as educational professionals, choose to inform the choices that we make for our practice with the best available evidence, we can make meaningful, striking enhancements to our pedagogical practice, and thus to the efficiency, effectiveness and success of our teaching and of children’s learning.
    * > Evidence-informed practice is still based on empirical evidence, but acknowledges the fact that it’s harder for real classroom practice to determine what works for whom under which circumstances.
