    * > Ofqual has today (8 January 2018) announced that non-exam assessment will not count to the final 9 to 1 grade in GCSE computer science in 2018 or 2019. It is, however, still an important part of the course and contributes to student learning and progress, so all schools must continue to give students the opportunity within the timetable to complete the tasks.

        * > We understand that features of working practice, such as collaboration and reference to online coding repositories,would not normally be allowed in exams.Exams are by their nature artificial constructs which allow a particular aptitude to be measured.There are many subjects where the established form of assessment does not reflect how the skills and understanding imparted during the course of study might be used in real-life contexts.Students will, of course, be able to work collaboratively and use online resources as they develop their programming skills.
        * > We also noted the point made by one teacher that assessment by examination is in fact the predominant form of assessment used in recruitment in industry: “Many organisations use only exam assessment to recruit new developers. It is therefore reasonable to assume that similar methods of assessment can be used by the exam boards.”

    * exam boards will be free to adopt approaches to assessing programming skills by examination that they feel are most appropriate from 2022 onwards. This affords them the opportunity to consult with stakeholders and be innovative in their approach
    * schools and colleges will confirm to their exam board that their students have been given the opportunity to complete a programming task as part of their course
    * the current interim arrangements, where schools and colleges must set aside 20 timetabled hours for students to undertake a programming task, will remain in place for students sitting exams up to 2021
