Teaching for Mastery
--------------------
* [Secondary Mathematics Teaching for Mastery: Some themes and key principles](https://www.ncetm.org.uk/media/q0ykgtje/secondary-teaching-for-mastery-march-2021.pdf)
    * > Lessons are designed to have a high-level of teacher-student and student-student interaction where all students in the class are thinking about, working on, and discussing the same mathematical content. Challenge and the opportunity to deepen understanding of the key mathematical ideas is provided for all.
    * > Every attempt is made to keep the whole class learning together. Differentiation is achieved, not through offering different content, but through paying attention to the levels of support and challenge needed to allow every student to fully grasp the concepts and ideas being studied.
    * > For those students who grasp ideas quickly, acceleration into new content is avoided. Instead, these students are challenged by deeper analysis of the lesson content and by applying the content in new and unfamiliar problem-solving situations. If some students fail to grasp an important aspect of the lesson, this is identified quickly, and early intervention ensures that they are ready to move forward with the whole class in the next lesson.
    * > Teachers use well-crafted examples and exercises which, through careful use of variation (including what to keep the same) focuses studentsâ€™ attention on the key learning point.
