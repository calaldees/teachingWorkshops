English as an Additional Language (EAL)
=================================

> 4.5. Teachers must also take account of the needs of pupils whose first language is not English. Monitoring of progress should take account of the pupil’s age, length of time in this country, previous educational experience and ability in other languages.

> 4.6. The ability of pupils for whom English is an additional language to take part in the national curriculum may be in advance of their communication skills in English. Teachers should plan teaching opportunities to help pupils develop their English and should aim to provide the support pupils need to take part in all subjects.

* What is being talked or written about. Think of the differences between a conversation about teaching and 
another about gardening, or between a social studies text 
and a biology text. 
¡ The relationship between the speakers. Imagine yourself 
chatting to a friend at a party and compare that with how 
you might respond to questions at a job interview.
¡ Whether the language is spoken or written. Imagine yourself watching 
a cooking demonstration where the cook is describing what he or she 
is doing. Then think about how the language would change if it were 
written in a cookbook.
Halliday and Hasan (1985) refer to these contextual features as fi eld, tenor, 
and mode
¡ Field refers to the topic of the text—what it is that is being talked or 
written about.
¡ Tenor refers to the relationship between speaker and listener (or 
writer and reader), such as the level of formality required.
¡ Mode refers to the channel of communication, for example, whether 
it is spoken or written

Together these three variables constitute what is referred to as the register 
of a text. As children learn their fi rst language, they gradually learn not only 
the syntax or grammar of the language, but also how to vary the language they 
use according to the context they are in. In other words, they learn to vary the 
register of the language so that it is appropriate for the context.


Moving towards academic langauge pg14
Text 1. Look, it’s making them move. Those didn’t stick.
Text 2. We found out the pins stuck on the magnet.
Text 3. Our experiment showed that magnets attract some metals.
Text 4. Magnetic attraction occurs only between ferrous metals.

The four texts demonstrate that it is problematic to talk about 
overall “profi ciency” in a language without taking into account the 
context in which the language will be used.

—the registers associated with academic learning may take up to seven 
years for the learner to develop at a level equivalent to a competent native 
speaker of the same age.
