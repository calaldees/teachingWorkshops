English as an Additional Language (EAL)

The SMOG calculator isn't perfect but can be a useful aid when planning and resourcing lessons. Just copy and paste a sample of your text into the space provided and press 'calculate'.
Underneath it will give you the SMOG score which is essentially the reading age, which you can compare to the students' recorded scores. A more detailed overview of SMOG can be found here: https://www.twinkl.co.uk/teaching-wiki/smog-in-literacy

> 4.5. Teachers must also take account of the needs of pupils whose first language is not English. Monitoring of progress should take account of the pupil’s age, length of time in this country, previous educational experience and ability in other languages.

> 4.6. The ability of pupils for whom English is an additional language to take part in the national curriculum may be in advance of their communication skills in English. Teachers should plan teaching opportunities to help pupils develop their English and should aim to provide the support pupils need to take part in all subjects.

* What is being talked or written about. Think of the differences between a conversation about teaching and 
another about gardening, or between a social studies text 
and a biology text. 
¡ The relationship between the speakers. Imagine yourself 
chatting to a friend at a party and compare that with how 
you might respond to questions at a job interview.
¡ Whether the language is spoken or written. Imagine yourself watching 
a cooking demonstration where the cook is describing what he or she 
is doing. Then think about how the language would change if it were 
written in a cookbook.
Halliday and Hasan (1985) refer to these contextual features as fi eld, tenor, 
and mode
¡ Field refers to the topic of the text—what it is that is being talked or 
written about.
¡ Tenor refers to the relationship between speaker and listener (or 
writer and reader), such as the level of formality required.
¡ Mode refers to the channel of communication, for example, whether 
it is spoken or written

Together these three variables constitute what is referred to as the register 
of a text. As children learn their fi rst language, they gradually learn not only 
the syntax or grammar of the language, but also how to vary the language they 
use according to the context they are in. In other words, they learn to vary the 
register of the language so that it is appropriate for the context.


Moving towards academic langauge pg14
Text 1. Look, it’s making them move. Those didn’t stick.
Text 2. We found out the pins stuck on the magnet.
Text 3. Our experiment showed that magnets attract some metals.
Text 4. Magnetic attraction occurs only between ferrous metals.

The four texts demonstrate that it is problematic to talk about overall “proficiency” in a language without taking into account the context in which the language will be used.

the registers associated with academic learning may take up to seven years for the learner to develop at a level equivalent to a competent native speaker of the same age.

    1. proper process to assess the level of an EAL learner on arrival at school
        * schools need to give teachers the tools to assess and measure this skill level so that they can gauge how to pitch their lesson content.
        * the Bell Foundation called the EAL Assessment Framework
        * In Planning
            * ‘What are the language development needs of my students?’
            * ‘What are the language demands of my lesson?’ , ‘What is they key vocabulary they will need in this lesson?’ and ‘How are students being asked to respond - is it written or spoken English?’
            * How can I plan opportunities for speaking and listening in English and does my lesson content match the home and school experiences of my pupils?’”
        * But what if your colleague down the corridor is doing very little EAL-specific work
        * Build whole school terminology
            * > word generation intervention
                * five new words each week and making them something the whole school will focus on learning that week.
            * (choose) academic vocabulary that will serve students well in all subjects, but that they may not encounter in everyday life.
                * “Words like ‘evaluate’, ‘reason’, ‘evidence’ 
            * > good EAL teaching is good teaching for all,
            * teachers need to be given the skills to understand how they identity the key terms, words and phrases that make part of the assessment within their learning topic to ensure they are addressed
            * buy-in from everyone to ensure it has a continual focus,
        * allowing pupils to bring their home language into learning alongside English is increasingly recognised as working well for EAL learners
            * (Combine with MFL?)
            * giving students autonomy to use their own language as and when makes sense
            * actively encouraging students to look up the topic in advance in their own language so that they come to the lesson with some vocab and understanding
            * makes parents feel their language is valued within the child’s education
            * home languages must not “take over” the school language.
            * setting students a task of recording a debate or discussion that can be recorded and analysed afterwards
