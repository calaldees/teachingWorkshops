===============================

* CCCU
    * Biggest gap in the country
        * CCCU 40% chance of getting a 2:1 or first and white 78% == 37%
        * National == 17%
        * 39% BAME "not sure about expected grade" - 23% white "Not sure" (they don't know the grading system)
    * Socioecomic don't explain this

* Blinders
    * We don't have data for that
    * We don't have capacity
    * We don't have the data
    * Someone else's responsibility

If I don't know the student - I just operate with my profetional experience - it's all about 'me' as the teacher
If I know the student - It's all about them

Masters tools will never dismantle masters house.

1st, 2nd, 3rd, Fail. We expect standatd deviaiton
This system will never lead to equity
Interventions address the symptons of the problem - and not tackel it

> If you don't deliberately privilege the disadvantaged, you will never have equity

> Students do well when they feel that they are likely to succeed

Decolonising
============

Decolonising is actually: Ongoing deconstructing and rethinking our values

Students are taught to know the subject and/or the world, without being a part of the subject/world.
White students are 'Affirmed'. Others are outcast

Evaluating a course
* Identity, Belonging and Community
    * opportunities to foster good relationships in students, develop compassionate learners and for students to see themselves in the world
* Criticality
    * 
* Cultural Capital
    * 

Step one - admit we are colonised.
Rebuild

* Build identity into curriculum
* Build competence
* Build Community
    * Peer to peer, academic staff
