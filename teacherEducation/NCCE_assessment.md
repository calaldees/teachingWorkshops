NCCE Assessment

Formative Assessment
---------------------

Blerkom (2010) "Measurement and Statistics for Teachers"

Recall bell tasks - three questions that prompt recall of prior learning

Concept maps
graphic organisers
Practice presentations
Observations
Learning logs
Diagnostic tests
Whiteboards
peer/self asssessment
Simulations
Think pair share
..

Formative assessment is embedded in teaching and learning

Clear Objectives
Know what they are aiming for
Involve students
Provide feedback so students regognise their next steps

Assessment for learning "Beyond the Black Box Assessment reform group 1999


### Example

What is it that the student does not understand

```python
import turtle as t

t.forward(100)
t.right(60)

t.forward(100)
t.right(60)

t.forward(100)
t.right(60)
```

* What shape does this produce?
* What do the numbers in the brackets mean?
    * 100?
    * 60?
* How will we know when the output is correct?
* Will it still work if the statements are in a different order
* What do we know about the angles of a triangle
* 

### The Big Question

Context for a series of lessons.
"Global Context"

> If computers never tire - are they better suited to some tasks than humans?

> With computers and networks you can communicate with anyone in the world. Is this a good thing? or a bad thing?

> What would happen if Google stopped working

### Hinge Question

```python
x = 10
print("Countdown started")
while x <= 10:
    print(x)
    x = x - 1
print("Take off!")
```

* Does the program ever stop?
* What does `while` do
* How many variables are used in the program
* Can the value of x be more than `10`
* What does the indentation do
* How many lines are printed to the screen
* Can we change the indentation? Would the program still work?
* Can we add a space and it still work
  

### Interleaving

> Interleaving refers to the benefits of seqencing leaning tasks so that similar items - two examples of the came concept are interspeersed with differnt types of itmes ...

Kang 2016

```
Interleaved ABCABCABCABC
Blocked AAAAAABBBBBBCCCC
```

* After block - retention falls off sharply (100% to 38%)
* Can't use topic A with topic B
* Prevents Fabricwation and Discrimation error
    * Eg just choosing a formula that they covered recenty rather than the correct one

Kelli Taylot and Doug Rohrer

Dont forget the earlyer blocks .. keeps recapping what happening 3 month, 6 months, 1 year ago

* Use starers to recap previous topics
    * Identify this in your (mid/long) planning


Summative Assessment
--------------------

> summative assessments are performed at the ed of chapters or units to determine the students level of competency ...

Blerkom 2017 "Measurements and Statistics for Teachers"


* Types?
    * Written reports
    * presentations
    * portfolios
    * written tests
    * rubric
    * projects
    * practical examinations
    * peer/self assessment




Issues from KS2 to KS3

* Struggle to use a keyboard and logon because they have only ever used a tablet
* Images you find on the internet are NOT all free to use
* Using Google and as "Answer engine" not a "Search engine"
    * They are not the answers


* Baseline assessment for 
    * KS2 to KS3 transition
        * CAT's + SAT's
        * Midyis
    * KS3 -> KS4?
    * etc
    * NCCE test to recommend courses
    * In your class? start of year?

* _Koding_ - LOOK IT UP! KS3 Game coding - Block based
* Blockly
* Blueprints

KS4
---

* Look at the definitions of the command words used by the exam board.
    * THIS IS NOT OBVIOUS TO STUDENTS. They words mean different things in different subjects

---

Mathematical operations on the same dataset are faster as results can be retrieved in less clock cycles from cache than main memory

mark scheme codes

elipsis means qualifying
bold means must


A = Accept
R = Reject
NE = Not Enough
I = Ignore

* Examiners report - for your "center average mark" for each question
* Identify common patters
