    1. Programming is intrinsic to computer science
    2. Programming teaches exceptionally useful skills
    3. Programming work is essential pedagogy
        * brings theory to life
        * enormously motivating for some
        * can build confidence. If they manage to develop strategies to solve new and unfamiliar 
        * Programming environments offer immediate, non-judgemental feedback
        * consolidates learning
        * develops a learnerâ€™s initiative and creativity. Much of school work is closed-form
    4. What good practical work looks like
        * tasks that they find personally relevant
        * collaborate
        * independent research
        * real-world problems
        * share their work with a wide audience
        * develop their knowledge
        * deepening and generalising their understanding
    5. What is "practical programming"?
        * Simply experimenting with the medium.
            * playful, exploratory
        * Run a program, and work out what causes it to do what it does. 
        * Copy an existing program, run it, and then start making small changes to it
        * Predict what a program does
            * tells you something important about things you do not understand
        * Predict what a change will do
            * actively experiment with their understanding of new concepts.
        * Test a program thoroughly to check it is working properly
        * Debug a program that is not working properly
        * Explain to someone else how/why your program works
            * The simple act of explaining your program often reveals latent bugs and reveals misconceptions
        * Read a program and figure out its purpose. For example
            * T := 0; for I = 1..N { T := T+I }
        * Starting from an idea of what you want your program to do, write a program from scratch to do it. 
            * This involves specification, design, abstraction, implementation, testing, and debugging.
        * Iteratively develop a large program: modify a large program to do more
            * (eg so that it does the same thing faster). 
            * key and critical way to develop large programs
