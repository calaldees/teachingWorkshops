If students can program, then they express higher levels of theory by building the solutions. 
It is therefore important to build students programming proficiency.

* [Code Reading Club](https://www.felienne.com/archives/6472)
    * Reading code is harder than writing code
    * We are VERY bad at teaching learners to read code
    * a strong focus on creating code, very often ‘green-field’ code, starting from a specification or a set of tests. 
        * This leads to the fact that programmers in generally are really poorly equipped to read code, even their own code, but especially code written by others.
    * novices read code more linearly than expert programmers.
        * Learning to follow the call stack it a thing that comes with experience
    * Deliberate Reading
        * Reading Questions:
            * What is the first thing that jumps out at me? Why?
            * What’s the next thing I notice? Are these two things connected? How?
            * Do they seem to be saying different things?
        * These sentences encourage and train ‘scanning’ behaviour, which we know is a thing programmers do. 
        * The beautiful thing about this technique is that is gives me a thing “to do” when reading code. Rather than mindlessly scrolling thought the code,
    * Relational-Text
        * Link each occurrence of a variable with it's declaration
        * Identify the scope of a variable

            *  Constructivist
                *  One must help a student discover the knowledge that is naturally found in his cognition

            *  e.g. get teachers doing the "right things" and their psychology will eventually change to match. Given time and seeing it first hand
    *  > the beginning of the process, artifacts of students guided by instructivist teachers were found to be higher in their programming level quality, compared to the products of students guided by constructivist teachers.
    *  > students who learn by constructivist guidance and over time gain experience in visual programming, close the gap with students learning under instructivist guidance in their ability to create an artifact at a good programming level. It can be assumed that ongoing constructivist guidance emphasizing active learning, encourages students to choose high standards for their projects
    *  > (constructivist) ... will ultimately lead students to overall and broader success in the learning process, although this does require additional time.

    * > this research also points out significant shortcomings of the current initiatives and provides suggestions for future improvement. In order to reasonably support the amount of resources and the time dedicated, research is needed to show how HoC improves K-12 student engagement.

    * Computing problem solver
        * Handles Ambiguity
            * Recognise there is more than one way to solve/describe a problem
        * Open Ended Problem Solver
            * don't just accept first solution
            * Look for a range of solutions to the same problem
            * Look for how a project can be extended
        * Evaluates
            * evaluate my solutions against a set criteria
            * Can design criteria to evaluate my creations
        * Copes with Complexity
            * Can break complex problems into parts
            * Can discover/concentrate on the most important part of a problem
        * Communicates
            * contribute useful idea to a partner or group
            * Can encourage others to share their idea
            * Lead using all the people talent in my group
        * Adapts
            * Can identify patters in problems and solutions
            * Can adapt existing ideas to solve new problems
        * Investigates
            * Can develop test and debug until a product is refined
            * make predictions about what will happen
            * repeatedly experiment though predicting, making, testing and debugging
        * Perseveres
            * Learn from setbacks and don't let them put me off
            * I can preserve even if the solution is not obvious

    * Could be a structure for group evaluation
    * six thinking hats
        * white hat	- facts/information
        * yellow hat - optimism/good
        * black hat - dangers/problems/devils-advocate
        * red hat - feelings
        * green hat - creatively/new-concepts
        * blue hat - chair-the-meeting/process
    * Whole team must be aligned with which hat they use
    * Meetings should be chained to address segments for all 6 hats
    * Commonly used in sprint retrospectives in professional software development
