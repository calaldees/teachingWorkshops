If students can program, then they express higher levels of theory by building the solutions. 
It is therefore important to build students programming proficiency.

        * Programming taught from the front of the class at best only ever effectively teaches a third of the class. Some can already progress further beyond what you are explaining and some are already lost and need additional support. Allowing students to learn independently at their own pace and choose their own challenges allows greater flexibility for the teacher to stretch and support individual students.
        * The role of the teacher is to maintain pace, provide individual interventions when students are stuck, review completed objectives and track progress.
        * Using these resources, students that are absent from class are not disadvantaged and can even continue their work at home. If a question is too difficult to answer, or a problem is too difficult to solve, these can be left to be discussed with the teacher. The student can still move on to the next objective or problem.

### TASK

(Adapted from NCCE Outstanding Programming Pedagogies course)

### Task 1 (15 min)
Read the various _Verbs_ and their extended descriptions that relate to teaching programming 

* Recognise
    * Base knowledge and vocabulary for the domain
        * Provide as much information you can about the construct being studied.  
        * This provides opportunities for students to make extended use of constructs knowing how they will develop and become more complex.  
        * Misconceptions can be covered and common problems that are experienced so that students can build resilience, knowing that mistakes and problems they encounter are not uncommon.
* Present
    * Explain a solution to others
        * Display code which extends their current knowledge of a given programming construct.
        * Students are to explain the code to a peer within a given constraint such as number of words, sentences or within a given time.
        * This aids their skills in explain errors that they might come across to teachers and peers, providing a greater focus on the key area for amendment.
        * This skill provides opportunities for students to read code, explore different styles of coding and reinforce their understanding of a construct.
* Relate
    * Understand solution in context of others
        * Students can be directed to different solutions to the same problem, sharing which approach might be best in terms of amount of code, time to develop, complexity and efficiency.
        * They can take a given solution and adapt it to meet the needs of a next context, further developing their generalisation skills.
* Refactor
    * Redesign a solution for optimisation
        * A new concept, one which will significantly stretch student’s knowledge can be demonstrated or shown so that the next level of understanding can begin with more advanced uses of programming constructs.
        * Often there will be a focus on the effectiveness or efficiency of a solution by considering such alternative techniques.
* Model
    * Illustrate or implement an abstraction of a problem
        * A concept can be provided either in written or diagrammatic form.
        * This enforces the need for students to consider what constructs can be combined to produce algorithms capable of solving the given concept in a manner that is computable.
        * Students benefit from seeing how real life concepts and models can be realised by applying the correct logic in order to develop effective and efficient solutions.
* Implement
    * Put a completed design into code 
        * Provide partially completed or abstracted designs or provide a written or bulleted summary to be translated into code.
        * This provides a challenge where students can feel supported from the ‘Know’ elements by constructing suitable algorithms with clear success criteria or requirements.
        * This provides students with the opportunity to focus on logic and syntax and develop independence by leaning on their debugging and logic skills.
* Design
    * Devise a solution structure
        * Provide a scenario for students to abstract and produce a design.
        * This could be in the form of a flowchart, pseudo code.
        * This enables students to create mental models, ask good questions in order to devise designs which are efficient and map effectively to programming constructs in the form of algorithms.
* Trace
    * Desk-check a solution
        * Code can be provided with given inputs and students need to predict the output or vice-versa.
        * This provides opportunities for students to read code, get best practice in terms of structure and to build confidence by understanding or predicting logic without the need to be able to write the construct syntactically.
        * This supports their ability to read different styles of coding among their peers and make better plans before implementation.
* Apply
    * Use a solution as a component in a problem
        * Offer a sub-section of code or part of a design for students to devise a solution by applying the construct accordingly.
        * This provides opportunities for students to build larger programs and exploring the depth of constructs in order to develop more complex and modular solutions.
* Debug
    * Both detect and correct flaws in design 
        * Provide opportunities for students to find errors in code or provide two examples and ask which example is free of code errors.
        * Students can also be asked to find one or more logical and syntax errors.
        * This develops their skills in reading code and building their independence so that the can spot and debug their own programs.
        * Students could also sabotage working code in order for their peers to unpick errors and return to working order.
* Adapt
    * Modify a solution for other domains
        * Students can also be provided with a solution for a given domain and adjust the code in order for the logic to remain the same but for the needs of a new scenario to be met.
        * This develops pupils understanding of how programming constructs can be applied to a range of domains and also enables them to identify the strengths of specific constructs through the exploration of examples that pose similar problems.
* Translate
    * Convert from block, text, flowchart, pseudo code and vice-versa
        * Provide examples of designs in pseudo and flowchart form with tasks for students to implement the designs in code and vice-versa.
        * This develops student’s ability to translate different designs and apply and combine programming constructs in line with logical thought.
* Analyse
    * probe the time complexity of a solution
        * Code snippets or algorithms can be given or displayed to students, giving them the opportunity to share their understanding and thoroughly investigate components of a construct or algorithm, decomposing parts.
        * From this, students make greater associations between different constructs and how they can combine effectively to create algorithms.

* Setup a group document
* In groups of 3: You are going to attempt to place the verbs in this grid 
    * Some cells have no verbs

    * Learner rearranges the lines of code to solve the task
    * benefit of Parson’s Problems is that the learner is focusing on the structure and logic of blocks of code, rather than the syntax of individual text elements (atoms). The process reduces the cognitive load experienced by learners, allowing them to practise sequencing and problem-solving with code.

* [Code Reading Club](https://www.felienne.com/archives/6472)
    * Reading code is harder than writing code
    * We are VERY bad at teaching learners to read code
    * a strong focus on creating code, very often ‘green-field’ code, starting from a specification or a set of tests. 
        * This leads to the fact that programmers in generally are really poorly equipped to read code, even their own code, but especially code written by others.
    * novices read code more linearly than expert programmers.
        * Learning to follow the call stack it a thing that comes with experience
    * Deliberate Reading
        * Reading Questions:
            * What is the first thing that jumps out at me? Why?
            * What’s the next thing I notice? Are these two things connected? How?
            * Do they seem to be saying different things?
        * These sentences encourage and train ‘scanning’ behaviour, which we know is a thing programmers do. 
        * The beautiful thing about this technique is that is gives me a thing “to do” when reading code. Rather than mindlessly scrolling thought the code,
    * Relational-Text
        * Link each occurrence of a variable with it's declaration
        * Identify the scope of a variable
        * Identify where a particular function is called

    * Visual/Block programming allows for my constructivist/self-exploration because the learners are protected from MANY incorrect programs
    * Four Models of “Theory of Mind” in Learning and Teaching (Olson & Bruner, 1996)
        * Folk Psychology
            * Instructivist
                * Learning is the ability to internalise a desired, demonstrated behaviour or skill
                * Learning is the transmissions of knowledge from the external environment to the learner
            * Constructivist
                * Learning is a discovery of personal knowledge though the unique experiences of each person
                * Learning is building personal knowledge while relying on existing scientific or cultural information
        * Folk Pedagogy
            * Instructivist
                *  Learning depends on the demonstrations an practice of required skill
                *  Knowledge is transmitted to the learner by a teacher though presentation and examination of the topic
            *  Constructivist
                *  One must help a student discover the knowledge that is naturally found in his cognition
                *  It is important to complement personal knowledge and experience by scientific or cultural information
    *  > all parameters indicate a higher quality of student artifacts created under guidance of constructivist teachers.
    *  Shows diagram of progression of instructivist Psychology and pedagogy through to constructivist Psychology and pedagogy
        *  Pedagogical change comes before Psychological change
            *  e.g. get teachers doing the "right things" and their psychology will eventually change to match. Given time and seeing it first hand
    *  > the beginning of the process, artifacts of students guided by instructivist teachers were found to be higher in their programming level quality, compared to the products of students guided by constructivist teachers.
    *  > students who learn by constructivist guidance and over time gain experience in visual programming, close the gap with students learning under instructivist guidance in their ability to create an artifact at a good programming level. It can be assumed that ongoing constructivist guidance emphasizing active learning, encourages students to choose high standards for their projects
    *  > (constructivist) ... will ultimately lead students to overall and broader success in the learning process, although this does require additional time.
    *  > After six months of experience under constructivist guidance, students were able to program with a base of wider personal knowledge and experience


Traditional Computational Thinking - New Computational Thinking
---------------------------------------------------------------

* [Remaining trouble spots with computational thinking](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2998438) Denning 2017
    * AWESOME ARTICLE!!!! (TODO Recommend on reading list)
    * Question 1: What Is Computational Thinking?
    * Question 2: How Do We Measure Students’ Computational Abilities?
        * > we have no consensus on what constitutes the skill and our current assessment methods are unreliable indicators.
        * > (in) 1958, philosopher Michael Polanyi discussed the difference between “explicit knowledge” (descriptions written down) and “tacit knowledge” (skillful actions). He famously said: “We know more than we can say.”
        * > To certify skills you need a model for skill development.
        * > These knowledge progressions are not the same as skill acquisition progression
        * > The CAS framework does not discuss abilities to be acquired during the progression
        * Employers are turning to competency-based assessment faster than educational institutions.
        * Many employers no longer trust transcripts and diplomas. Instead they organize interviews as rigorous problem-solving sessions with different groups in the company.
        * An applicant will not be hired without demonstrating competence in solving the kinds of problems of interest to the employer.
        * The idea of assessing skill by performance is actually quite common in education. In sports, music, theater, and language departments, for example, students audition for spots on the team, places in the orchestra, roles in the play, or competency certificates at a language. Although code-a-thons are becoming more prevalent and many computing courses include projects that assess skill by performance, 
        * computing education would benefit from a deep look at competency-based assessment
    * Question 3: Is Computational Thinking Good for Everyone?
        * In Traditional CT programming ability produces CT, and in New CT learning certain concepts produces programming ability
        * Traditional CT
            * Programs are tightly coupled with algorithms; programs are algorithms expressed in a computer language; algorithms derive their precision from a computational model
        * New CT (Jeannette Wing coined in 2006) Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon [Computational Thinking](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1118178.1118215)
            *  > “everyone, not just those who major in computer science, can benefit from thinking like a computer scientist"
                * this general claim has never been substantiated with empirical research
            * Programs are loosely coupled with algorithms; algorithms are for all kinds of information processors including humans—it is completely optional whether an algorithm will ever be translated into a program
    * > use competency-based skill assessments to measure student progress. Be wary of the claim of universal value, for it has little empirical support
    * > Focus on helping students learn to design useful and reliable computations in various domains of interest to them
    * > It would do all of us good to tone down the rhetoric about the universal value of computational thinking. Advocates should conduct experiments that will show the rest of us why we should accept their claims.
