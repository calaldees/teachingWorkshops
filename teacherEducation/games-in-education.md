    * Not working in education
* Games are modern technology
* Foundation: Things we take for granted
    * We need Practical "and" Language
        * Most things taught this way
        * People are good in mimicry - we learn non linguistically
        * Telling how to build fire without doing it is not enough - practical is needed - not seen something they can mimic

    * Words add objectivity

    * Maths as a language conceptualise complex concepts and process's
    * Mathematical notation is kind of hard and advanced
* Music notation, Film, all useful, none are all encompassing replacement

    * Games = Non-linguistic communication
