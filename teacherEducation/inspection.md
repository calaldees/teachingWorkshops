School inspection criteria for Computing (10min)
-----------------------------------------

Copy paste from
[computingAcrossCurriculum.md](./computingAcrossCurriculum.md) #Ofsted and Computing (how link to heading?)

From Ofsted Education Inspection Framework

* Teaching in computing is good or better when:
    * it is rooted in the development of pupils’ understanding of important concepts and progression within the lesson and over time; it enables pupils to make connections between individual topics and to see the ‘big picture’
    * teachers use a very wide range of innovative and imaginative resources and teaching strategies to stimulate pupils’ active participation in their learning and secure good or better progress across all aspects of the subject.
* The computing curriculum is good or better when:
    * the contexts in which computing is taught are relevant to pupils’ lives and reflect the increasing use of computing in the world of industry
    * excellent links are forged with other agencies and the wider community to provide a wide range of enrichment activities to promote pupils’ learning and engagement with the subject
    * links with other subjects in the school are productive in strengthening pupils’ learning in computing
* Leadership of computing is good or better when
    * there are effective strategies to delegate subject responsibilities where appropriate and to share good practice
    * computing has a very high profile in the life of the school
* Finally ...
    * E-safety is now considered in the inspection of all education remits including the early years sector, further education and skills, and initial teacher education.

Hummm: I can't see much in this that prescribes computing as a standalone subject?
THIS IS IMPORTANT!!
