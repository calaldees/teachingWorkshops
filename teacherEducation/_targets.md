Lesson observations that identify that students are engaging with the specified activity. 1.) The teacher identify students that are not displaying expected behaviour 2.) teacher performs intervention to correct the intended behaviour.
There is a reduction in the amount of off-task/disruption time in lessons over a sequence of lessons (6-weeks/term)

Ensure each Computing lesson explicitly promotes the national literacy strategy.
Each computing lesson should explicitly attempt to build vocabulary and promote some form of written communication.
Lesson plans should identify provision.
Student answers/work could be used to evidence student use/improvement in literacy/terminology/vocabulary/understanding over a period of 6 lessons (term?)
