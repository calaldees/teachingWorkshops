The challenges for ITE
-----------------------

Chris Shelton

* Whats new in ITE
    * Market Review
        * 179/240 ITT providers re-accredited
        * Withdraw, merge or dormant
        * "Market Sufficiency Team"
    * Recruitment
        * Overall fell 20% in 2022
        * Computing met 30% of target in 2022
        * Computing predicted at [26%](https://twitter.com/JackWorthNFER/status/1638787791525130241) for 2023
        * Courses are closing because of no uptake
    * Inspection
        * In 22/23, Computing was deep dived in 3 secondary and 4 primary (out of 40)
    * ECF and CCF frameworks
        * No frameworks for embedding technology in education (Shelton and Lansley 2022)
        * "DfE EdTech Strategy"
        * 45 Trainees starting with TeachFirst (nationally) in September 2023
            * Ran a part time route
                * Can train part time, but schools only want full time positions
                * Training and school employers should allow this

TeachFirst is predominantly taught online
* augmented reality in classroom situations

* Teachers need support with building education technology tools
* CCF has nothing on this
    * Working memory, is limited and can be overloaded
    * Dual Coding
* "Algorithms to live by"
* Presentaitons
    * xx principles
* Anticipating common misconceptions
    * debugging teaching
* Papert "less worry about being wrong"
* Systematic synthetic phonies is the most effective approach for teaching pupils to decode
    * Jane Waite - "OR tree"
* ChatGTP is Vygotsky ZPD
* Pupils struggle to transfer what has been learnt to one disciple to a new or unfamiliar context
* Jannet Wing "Computational thinkgin" does not work
    * Guzdial 2016 refutes wing
    * Tedre and Denning 2016
* Novice teachers learn differently to full on teachers
    * Break down into standard component parts
* Notional Machines (model of how children aquire new skills)
    * of the classroom
    * Threshold concepts
* Lister 2011 Reading code comes before writing code
* Give example lessons to tweak
* Effective Novices Rountree 2003
    * about their stratergies
* "CCF is an entitlement and not a limit" Miles Berry 2023


Discussion
===========

* Computing should be used creatively in early years and primary
