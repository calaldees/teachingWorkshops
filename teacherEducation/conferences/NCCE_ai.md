Shift of emphasis -> from _computation_ more to information and data

Dr of AI. Works as AI lead for BT

We should not adjugate responsibility for our ballupz with AI
AI being a board-member
The AI should be accountable, the board/humans should. It is just a tool to suggest

Combining Human and AI is most effective (see chess)

AI could _personalise_ education

We need diversity of thought with AI


Questions
---------

You dont need to code 24/7 to be a coder, you can be well rounded.
If you understand the core ideas you can upskill in a domain quickly

"Both to build trust and encourage enough scrutiny"
If you understand the technology, you can trust it more and criticize it more.
You cant question a _black box_. Remove the magic. A little bit of light is good.

Growing up with AI

Children program their own smart device
