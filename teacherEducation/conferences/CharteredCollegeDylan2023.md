Chartered College Annual Lecture - Dylan Wilam
==============================

The role of Research in improving education

* is education is Research based profetion
* 50% of GP's prescrive antibiotics for virusus
* majority of decision could be "right" and researched. This will never be the case for education

Promesus the act of creating something with knowlege


A framework for thinking about change
To chnage something we need to understand why things are like they are
* What resacch can and cant do

* "Chestertons fence"
    * See a fence - let's take it down - if you cant tell me why it's there, then I wont let you take it down
* Proposals for change should answer two questions
    * What will it do better
    * What will it do worse (if this is empty then fire them!)
* There will ALWAYS be tradeoffs, we need to make this explicit
    * There are NO trade off free changes
* Evidence based is a continuum, not a category
  
* Research can
    * Indidate ares where improvemnse are unlikely to imporve education
    * how much improvement is likely
    * Provide information about the ..
* Two kinds of learning environment
    * Kind learning environment
        * what you lean is one context is useful in another
    * Wiked learning environments
        * Things are unrealted
* "Performance" IS NOT "learning"
    * Men in black nuralisers - the lesson improved perfoamce, but did not mean learning
* Learning
    * permianint change
* Perforamnce
    * temporay
* Rats could be aquiring skills (leaning a maze), but no evidence of this until the food was put down
* Learning and performance have an inverse relationship
    * Desireable difficulties Of encoding and retreval
* How learning could fail
    * Not engaged
    * Engaged bye just compling
    * Students are cognitivly active on the wrong stuff
    * Students are cognativly active, but without cognative overload
* Weak signal; lots of noise
    * Everyone looks better when they are teaching cleverer kids
* Things that work in the short term can be ineffective or be even counter productive later
    * Millitary instructors
        * Less experienced instructors got better grades
            * They were preparing them for "this years exam"
        * More experience instuctors got worse grades 
            * They were laying the foundations for future 
        * Students universally like teachers that make things easier for them - students prefer bad teaching
* The more times doctor has done a procedure, the better they are? right?
    * it's not a practice effect, it's a teamwork effect not just the surgen
        * "How long have been working with the surgen"
    * Top sets do better because they allocate the best teachers to the top sets
        * A good stratergy is the best teachers to the lowest sets
* The tennsess STAR study
    * Randomly assigned class's to differnt sizes - does not give you the answer
    * middle class Parents pattitioned to have their kids moved to smaller class sizes
    * Could not recruit rural schools because the rural schools did not have enough kids
    * What about the schools that did not volenteer.
* Five questions to ask of research
    * Does this solve a problem we have?
    * If we do this how much faster will our stuents learn
    * What wil be the cost
    * Can we implement it here
    * Do we know what to do?
* In india
    * money will make people work harder (not really)
* External rewards - increase perfoamcen on low complexity low creative job
* Artists what work on their own stuff are more creative than commisiions
* Effect size - you cant compare results from two different experiments
    * Normally use "standardized effect size"
    * Subtract off the "normal business as usual progress"
    * net effect verse gross effect
* Solving problems 
    * better for better for expers
    * worse for novices
* Worked examples
    * Degrades performance of experts
    * Help novices
* Research that show "no change" are not published ... this is problematic .. we only publish the "good results"
    * How many times to you have to flip a coin to tell if it's bias
    * We need to publish all studies
    * Most things that are published are the really big effects that get passed the threshold size
    * People do research - swtich hypothsis after the results are known
    * The true effect is only 1/3
* Interventions vary in 
    * Duration
    * intensity
    * ..
* one years learning for a 6 year old is 1/6 - with 16 year olds it's 1/16 of their life
    * Impact on younger learners is always more impactful
* To get the average effect size (yeah - all of them)
    * Signficant studes
    * non significant studies
    * not reported
    * Not conducted
* Distance of assessment from the curriculum - sensitiity to instruction
    * Close
    * Proximal
    * Distral
* Effecti sizes are justificable only when they are unessary
    * You only need them when your comparing differnt things
    * in mediciae they use the same outcome measures (survivaility after 5 years)
* Any improvement in edcaional process manifests istself by students learning faster
    * "months improvement" more effective than "effect size"
* Moderator anlyssis
    * e.g. "were the best teachers given to the top sets"
* Going back to the Tensessee STAR student
    * So we conclude that smaller sizes makes things better ...
    * So now we need in calafornia - we need 1,000's of new teachers .. teacher quality drops because you needs more of them
    * We should go the other way - bigger class's with better teachers
* No "gold standard" in research
* "It's so bad, it's not even wrong"
    * Nobody knows what the training was, what the invention 
* Four things to look for
    * Adequate theorisation
    * Standardised interventions
    * Pre-registered studides
    * Intention-to-treat analysis
        * "It was so complex to implement, that only the best teachers could make head or tail of it"
* Educators needs to be critical consumers of research
* Pisa test (they are just an IQ test)
    * science, english, maths
    * "You've been told to represent your country"
* Action research == just for the individual 
    * most teachers don't have the skills to know if this can be reproduced in other settings
* Tutoring works, but not at scale - how do we brings teachers up to this level
* Is the CCF working/good?
    * We don't know what makes a good curriculum
* Textbooks are underrated! developed over a period of time and refined
    * Stop changing the national curriculum
* Most classroom teachers can't fit in research reading
    * maybe we should not be aiming for that
    * Research papers are not written for teachers to implement - they are written for researchers
    * "Make it Stick" book (investigate)
    * Books co-written between teachers and scholars (!! Awesome!)
* Teacher retention
    * "Making room for impact" - 
    * Deimplement what teachers do so teachers can get their lives back
    * "blunt saw through a tree" "why dont you sharpen the saw" "because I have'nt got time"
