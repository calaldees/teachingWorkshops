Pair programming
Use modify create

PRIMMM

Peer instruction

```python
a = 3
b = (a == 3)
print(b)
```

Worked examples

* Parsons problems
    * cut up code - put in envelope - give envelope to students
    * discuss with friends

* Break down the task
* Use examples
* Work together
* Read code before writing

Cognative load reduced
Correct or better mental model
Confidence in discussing programms
Better use of programming vocabulary

* Predict - what would happen when we run this - write it down
* Run - (Don't type it in!) - have ready
* Investigate 
    * Block Model Schulte 2008
        * questions should focus on
            * Structure
            * Function 
            * program execution
        * At these levels
            * Atomic
            * Block
            * Relationps
            * Macro level
    * Article by sue (find article online)
* Modify (incomplete)

Sue Primm papers

conversations are less about syntax (this dont work miss) and using vocab about what the program actually does - talking at a higher level

Focus on class talk and dialog
Findings around 
* Questioning
* Dialogue
* Vocabulary
* Explanations


ISA paper

Makeing 

1. Lead with concepts
2. Unplug, unpack, repack
3. Create projects
4. Challenge misconceptions
12. 

How we teach computing 12 pedagogical principles

"Research Bites"

Break down task
use examples and starter code
Work together and keep talking
Read code before writing

Cultraully responsive pedagogy - equity in computing classroom

semantic waves - (read)

EPIC
KPRIDE
T-PRIMM

sue stopped using visualisation tools

silent starters - clam them down + focus
visual programming languges - checkout 'branch'? 'scratch'

block programming reduces cognitive load by removing syntax errors
how much do they not understand the syntax and how many dont understand the problem

Professor of novice learning programming

Challenges of teaching novice computer programming studies

* Programming is hard
* High failure rates
* Knowledge very low (to sequential courses)

Why is programming difficult

* RA1
    * Students backgtound abilities are not enough to learn programming
* RA2
    * The ususal teaching methods are not adiquate
* RA3 
    * Students personsal perceptions are insuffuent and motivation is low
        * Problem solving
        * Syntax
        * Misconceptions
        * IDEs without pedagoical features
        * Hiracy of skills

Students have insufficnet mathmatics background

Insufficen t Logic knowlege

Writing a programs about logic and problem solving, not about technology

Cant be individualised
learning styles
Visual/Sensory/Active/Sequential (Felder Model)

Captivate and motivate
