1. New class's of medai heavy applications becaome available
    1. Pictures, sound, Gestures
2. From rules to data
    1. Drawings
    2. Sports
    3. Web sesrcesh
    4. cartoon pictures
    5. sound clips
3. Shift in the role of syntax
    1. Harder bits in learning programming
    2. Block based (attempt to reduce this)
    3. Wolfram Programming Lab
    4. eCraft2Learn (Ken Kahns snap tools)
4. Age approriatelness
    1. ML tools scale well to deffernt age groups
5. Natural forms of interaction
    1. Video, Pictures, Body, posts, natural language (not syntax heavy)
6. The algorithmic step
    1. "From codeing to teachable machines" Druga 2018
    2. In traditional programming one can trace a program execution step by step
        1. programms are designed by stepwise tools
    3. Nural netowrk "steps" are not key
        1. Describing user intentions
7. Glass & Black Boxes
    1. All computing education uses abstraciton to hide complexity and focus on whats important
    2. ML models are exreamly opaque; individual weights and paramaters make no sense to humans
8. New Notional machines
    1. What happens in the runtime environment when a program is executed
    2. e.g. Java
        1. Named memory locaitons
        2. control flow
    3. So what kinds of notional machines are needed for describing describing
        1. Neural netowk, training a network
9. Testing and debugging
    1.  Debugging ML models != debugging program code
    2.  ML modesl are soft: no discretae results
    3.  ML models are brittle
    4.  ML Modesl are opaque
10. Goodness of solutions
    1.  Trust in ML models?
    2.  Emergence dominates
11. Ste(A)m inteegation
    1.  Epistomology of rule based programming: deductive, positviist
    2.  Episemology of data- driven computing; inductive
12. Banashing Magic
    1.  Tenent of technolgy education: teach the student how the world around them works
    2.  But how do the following work
        1.  TikTok recomendations
        2.  Face recodnition
        3.  Speach recodnition
        4.  Translation
    3.  ML isnt magic
    4.  ML systems are not intelligent
    5.  They are cleverly designed technology trained with 
13. Ethical and societal Implications
    1.  Privacy
    2.  Surveilence
    3.  Tracking
    4.  Job Losses
    5.  Misinformation
    6.  Algorithmic Bias
    7.  Diversity

* CT1.0 Rule Driven
    * Formalise the prpblem
    * Correctness can be formally prove
    * Transparent
    * Structured data
    * stepwise
    * reductionisum
* CT2.0 Data driven
    * Descibe the job and collect data
    * Models may display higher lower confidence
    * Blackbox
    * Unstructed data
    * paralalael
    * emergence

XAI - Explainbale AI

Playground tensorflow.org

They learn workflows. 
How do they colelct data, 
Catagorise data
Review data/output

Teach to recodnise their own emotions
smile ways happy


PIC, GDM (chilren )

Ethics of pupils collecting personal data
Busy work of collecting data - are their pretrained datasets? are they valuable?

ML != The human brain - this is a bad misconception
