The website we have been suggested to gauge the difficulty of a piece of text is: 
https://charactercalculator.com/smog-readability/ 
The SMOG calculator isn't perfect but can be a useful aid when planning and resourcing lessons. Just copy and paste a sample of your text into the space provided and press 'calculate'.
Underneath it will give you the SMOG score which is essentially the reading age, which you can compare to the students' recorded scores. A more detailed overview of SMOG can be found here: https://www.twinkl.co.uk/teaching-wiki/smog-in-literacy

ITT Core Framework

> 3.10. Every teacher can improve pupils’ literacy, including by explicitly teaching reading, writing and oral language skills specific to individual disciplines

> 4.7. High-quality classroom talk can support pupils to articulate key ideas, consolidate understanding and extend their vocabulary.

### What are schools expected to deliver?

* [Improving literacy in secondary schools a shared responsibility](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/413184/Improving_literacy_in_secondary_schools_-_report_summary.pdf) Ofsted 2013
    * > In the secondary schools where teachers in all subject departments had received training in teaching literacy and where staff had included an objective for literacy in all the lessons, senior managers noted an improvement in outcomes across all subjects, as well as in English.

### The Secret of Literacy

> Focussing on literacy objectives will not improve anything.
> Instead, what’s needed is for teachers to _explicitly teach the language of their subject_ alongside their subject content.
> My slightly surprising insight is that if this is done well, the fact that children’s reading and writing improves is almost trivial.
> What really matters is that students get better at thinking.
[The Secret of Literacy: making the implicit explicit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Secret-Literacy-Making-implicit-explicit/dp/1781351279/) - [David Didau](https://learningspy.co.uk/literacy/what-to-do-about-literacy/) 2014 978-1781351277


* We need literacy to in order to think
* Language shapes how we think
* To think like a computer scientist you have to talk like a computer scientist

What is the tipping point from _'just using words that scientists use'_ and _'talking like a scientist'_?

Categorising Vocabulary
* active/expressive vocabulary (words that are used autonomously)
* passive/receptive vocabulary (words that are understood and can be responded)
* unknown vocabulary

Figures (need to correlate exact source - these are from David Didau's book)
* Age 7 - top 25% have vocabulary of 7,100 words - bottom 25% 3,000 (parents?)
* Age 16 - 1 in 12 students has a working vocabulary of 800 words
* An average graduate has a vocabulary of 20,000 words

* [Matthew principle/effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect) - accumulated advantage (e.g. rich get richer)
* The young people that have a larger vocabulary have an ongoing compound interest advantage

### The _Language_ of Computer Science (20min)

#3-SubjCur-Learn-how-16-develop_terminology_vocabulary

> Some words have specific meaning in the computer science community, but a slightly or sometimes completely different meaning in everyday discourse (e.g. nouns like code, memory, address, folder, loop, bug, value, or verb to save, to code, to retrieve, to submit)

TASK: In your groups - add rows to the following table (10min group) + (5min whole class)
(My hope is that the list you generate could a useful resource for your future teaching)

| Computing Term | Possible interpretation | Technical meaning |
|-|-|-|
| Hot Key | The colour key on a graph that is referring to temperature | todo? |
| Address | Where I live | todo? |
| Inspect a log | From a tree, maybe it has ants | Filter/inspect historical system activity for diagnosis of issues |
| Submit a request | Have to ask for something from someone in authority | A data request to an external/separate system |
| add more | _Expand this list_ | add more |

<details>

| term | possible |
|-|-|
| Python | A snake that is poisonous |
| Secondary Storage | My nans garage |
| Code review | A friend checking my secret message before I send it |
| I created a code | 
| Save | Money at the bank |
| Search | Like hide and seek |
| Library | 
| Jesus Saves | So I save my files too 
| Memory | How much you can remember
| Network | Friendship? - building nets?
| Windows | cant see though it
| Apple Mac | Keeps fruit dry
| Praommy on TV |
| Cloud | up therir
| Directory | Telephone or direction guide 
| Fishing emails | I dont want to eat thing
| Web| Spider web |

### Computing Vocabulary
#3-SubjCur-Learn-how-17-build_verbal_fluency
Specifically plan keywords/vocabulary in your lesson plans and schemes of work. This could be a useful exercise to run with your department.

Facilitating Meta-Discourse - Computer Science Education - Sentence 2019
1. Clarify meaning in other non-cs contexts
2. Speculation about possible meanings (what it could or could not be)
3. Develop CS related meaning

#3-SubjCur-Learn-how-4-develop_analogies_examples
* Be very explicit that you are using a metaphors
    * Metaphors can seed misconceptions
    * Metaphors: The data is transferred -> I will move the file to another folder
    * Computer is a living being: it fell asleep and woke up 

Busch 1998

> Unless we want to dumb down the curriculum to the point at which it's completely valueless, its impossible to penetrate the meaning of academic subjects using everyday language

### Computer Science Phrases (20min)

I want to explicitly incite you to explore/exercise your Computer Science terminology as part of this session.
e.g. give them two statements and ask them which one is technical and correct and why.

* Examples of real computer science language
    * _do, while_ is an iteration pattern
    * What is the performance of the algorithm (n, n2, nlogn etc...)
    * Are these intermediary variables required in order to perform this comparison?
    * Does the algorithm fit the logic space of the problem (i.e. if you're looking for largest prime numbers, do you need to loop through all numbers?)
    * Can you identify any side effects that might be caused by changing state within this method?
    * Old cartridge based games consoles did not have an operating system
* Examples of rubbish mumbo jumbo
    * I'm hacking the mainframe
    * Reroute the encryption key through a blockchain
    * Use a trans-half reduction to ensure the AI reaches peak performance
    * You can compute the bubble sort maxima with an algorithm
* If you want inspiration
    * [wikipedia List_of_algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms)

TASK: Can you create a list of Computing phrases. Some that are _real_ and some that are _fake_. You could possible use this as a fun starter with your groups. Can they identify the nonsense from the real computer talk. You can then follow up with the class what the real ones mean. This is explicit vocabulary exercise.
* In your group breakout rooms: Add them to the Google Doc (10min)
    * It may be worth you categorising some of these with a difficulty level (maybe KS3, KS4, KS5)?
* Present to whole group (5min)

### Exam Board phrases

* [Glossary of GCSE command words from AQA](https://filestore.aqa.org.uk/resources/computing/AQA-8525-CW.PDF)
    * The language of exams - can be explicitly taught
* [TES: Exam command words display Computer Science AQA GCSE](https://www.tes.com/teaching-resource/exam-command-words-display-computer-science-aqa-gcse-12581059)

> On my first job as a designer, I had no idea what my boss was asking me to do. Online, I had learned about “paper prototypes” and “iterating on mockups.” But here he was telling me to “sketch a wire” and “riff on that comp.” I felt like he was speaking another language.

#### Strategies to integrate _literacy_ into our classroom practice? (30min)

An Ofsted inspector has asked you "What strategies do you have in place to integrate _literacy_ into our classroom practice?"

In groups consider strategies that you might be able to use (15min):

Think about:
* How we present topics?
* How we create resources?
* How we setup our environment/room?
* Assessment?

#### Pop culture aside - StarTrek (as social commentary)

* Original StarTrek episode [Mirror, Mirror](http://www.chakoteya.net/StarTrek/39.htm) with a parallel universe evil enterprise. 
* A few of our original crew end up on the _evil enterprise_. They blended in by pretending to behave like assholes. 
* Meanwhile, the evil crew attempted to infiltrate the _good enterprise_ were immediately put in the brig.
* > KIRK: What I don't understand is how were you able to identify our counterparts so quickly?
* > SPOCK: It was far easier for you as civilised men to behave like barbarians, than it was for them as barbarians to behave like civilised men.
* Without the language you can't mimic the use of the language

### Finally

* Literacy could be considered _more_ than a _skill_. It is the power to interact and understand the world.
* Check the EIF - how many times is literacy mentioned?

* User Friendly
    * These are meaningless and unqualified, don't let even KS3 students do this. We need to promote their ability to say why.



Hirsch
reading should not be used to teach new topics - too much cgnative load - use reading to improve vocabulary and knowlege of existing are
cunninghan and stanovich - read volume in early years to improve

the activities that follow the reading are just as important as the reading itself

okenhill
depth of work knowledge and ability to make inferences
activities designed to decode words and understand language should require prior knowledge and understanding

vocabulary should be revisited in different ways to cement it
collaborative learning. students should be given the opportunity to discuss vocabulary

DARTS - directed activities relating to texts - analyse or reconstruct
highlight words in different categories (e.g words they did not understand is a category)
match key words to their defenitions
treasure hunt: find specific types of words and describe their purpose
fill in the blanks: -> then make their own fill in the blanks activity (improve vocab and sentence structure)


read individually (with scaffold) then read again as class

reading should be used to summerise previously learnt content
vocabulary activities related to readin should have a specific purpose, encouage recall and challange
vocabulary development should be a mixture of indipendent and collaborative learning (individually for assessment)
