Technologies for Teaching Computing
===================================


* EEF [Using Digital Technology to Improve Learning](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/education-evidence/guidance-reports/digital) [recommendations poster pdf](https://d2tic4wvo1iusb.cloudfront.net/eef-guidance-reports/digital/EEF_Digital_Technology_Summary_of_Recommendations.pdf)
    1. Consider how technology will improve teaching and learning before introducing it
    2. Technology can be used to improve the quality of explanations and modelling
    3. Technology offers ways to improve the impact of pupil practice
    4. Technology can play a role in improving assessment and feedback


ITT CCF
* > 2.2 Secure subject knowledge helps teachers to motivate pupils and teach effectively


Async Tasks
-----------

### Task 1 - Microbit
[microbit](../physicalProgramming/microbit/README.md)


### Task 2 - TinkerCAD (30mins to 1hour)

* [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/)
    * [Program an LED Light Show](https://www.tinkercad.com/lessonplans/program-an-led-light-show)
    * Explore?
* Consider possible activities/use in the classroom to be discussed with group

### Task 3 - Virtualisation (30min to 1hour)

* [[virtualisation]]


Lecture (sync) 1hour?
==============

Browser Based Development Environments

Machine Virtualisation
----------------------

* Technologies
    * VirtualBox
    * HyperV (Built in to Windows 10 Pro)

* `vt-x` hardware virtualisation extensions (REALLY important)
    * May need to be enabled in BIOS

* Virtual linux
    * You can manage the virtual hard disk image
    * Update central image and distributed to machines?
    * As a computing teacher - This means you don't need to badger technicians for every package installation
* Whole class teaching - with technician support
    * Could put VM's on a different subnet for full port access between VM guests
* Encourage students to make a VM - they can move the VM between machines
    * even bring it into school on USB (virtualbox) - (need more investigation)
