How Students Learn
==================

* [A Theory of Applied Mind of Programming](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3304221.3325596) 2019 ongoing PhD - Understanding the challenges in learning to program 
    * > Solving problems with computing is  complex  and  multidisciplinary
    * > Learning models typically focus on knowledge acquisition, but in programming knowledge must be applied to problem-solving.
    * > Programming is an artificial construct driven by many symbols, the programming language, but often  with an invisible result that makes developing  mental models of action and abstract images challenging.

Theory to Practice
------------------

All of this theory is useful. To make it have real world application in your teaching, you should always be thinking:

"With this theory ... When I am planning a lesson I will ..."

What ... so what ... now what

* After each theory chunk
    * What does this mean for your computing planning?
    * Write your reflections - discuss in pairs after each segment?

If you don't "say it", "write it" or "do it": you've probably not learnt it to any degree of fluency

Is Intuition the Enemy of Teaching and Learning?
* Reading easy - so must be working
* Retrieval feels harder - so must not as effective

If I talk at you, that may feel easy. All the great knowledge going at you. But is it effective.

* This session: Masters level free-form theory deep dive brawl.
* You explore a range of theories. Keep discussing "what is this, what does this mean for my teaching"
* Stockpile a range of reference amo for SP1

Have the [Computing National Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study#key-stage-3) to hand


Old Theories

    * > Teacher-training textbooks and courses sometimes propagate misunderstandings about learning
        * Dr Yana Weinstein and Dr Megan Sumeracki 2018
    * [Dual Coding and Learning Styles](https://www.learningscientists.org/blog/2019/6/6-1) - learning styles not effective
        * > Dual coding and learning styles sound similar, but are not quite the same thing. 
            > While dual coding has scientific evidence backing its use, 
            > learning styles has been repeatedly tested and shown not to improve learning.
* Video [Howard Gardner on Multiple Intelligences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYgO8jZTFuQ) Gardener 1997
    * In 20 years - education has moved on. The idea that _individuals learn in different ways_ has largely been debunked. Much more is now known about the way we encode, chunk and schema knowledge.
    * For follow-up later

TASK: 
1. Watch the first 2min of the video - 
2. Read the first few pages of YouTube comments in this video
3. Discuss - Quick Thoughts

Masters Level: Be critical of all of these theories. Why might they not be the whole picture?

    * Teach critical thinking, not facts
    * Reading is a skill
    * Learning styles
    * Teach kids to "think like a scientist"
    * Facts don't matter because you can look anything up on the internet

    * My Notes
        * Teachers are _success's_ of the education _system/process_ and enjoy learning
        * > (teachers are) dejected when they find that some of their pupils don’t like school much
        * > ... teachers should reconsider how they encourage their students to think in order to maximize the likelihood that students will get the pleasurable rush that comes from successful thought
        * > our brains are designed not for thought, but for the avoidance of thought
        * > Most of the problems you face are ones you’ve solved before, so you just do what you’ve done in the past
        * > Using memory doesn’t require much of your attention, so you are free to daydream
        * > Working on a problem with no sense that you’re making progress is not pleasurable. In fact, it’s frustrating. And there’s not great pleasure in simply knowing the answer either.
        * > (people) quickly evaluate how much mental work it will take to solve the problem. If it’s too much or too little, people stop working on the problem
        * > successful thinking relies on four factors: 
          >   1. information from the environment,
          >   2. facts in long-term memory,
          >   3. procedures in long-term memory,
          >   4. and space in working memory.
          >
          > If any one of them is inadequate, thinking will likely fail. 
        * > scan each lesson plan with an eye toward the cognitive work that students will be doing. How often does such work occur? Is it intermixed with cognitive breaks? When you have identified the challenges, consider whether they are open to negative outcomes
        * > Respect Students’ Limited Knowledge and Space in Working Memory
        * > what the key question for that lesson might be, and how you can frame that question so that it will be of the right level of difficulty to engage your students
        * > (some students) are behind the others; giving them work that is beyond them is unlikely to help them catch up,
        * > you must first be sure that they believe that they can improve, and next you must try to persuade them that it will be worth it
        * Praise the process they tackled the task with
            * _Poor test results_ == you didn't put in the time
        * > do your slower students really know how to study?
        * > Catching Up Is the Long-Term goal ... to catch up, slower students must work harder than the brighter students.
        * > their _important teacher_ set high standards and believed that they could meet those standards.
        * > be wary of praising second-rate work

When reading; make notes about action points that would affect the planning of your computing lessons.

Many of the topics touched on in the reading will be explored in more detail in the session.

TASK: From our reading - Discuss
1. How do we Learn?
2. How will this affect planning our computing lessons?

### The Science of Learning

* [The Science of Learning](https://deansforimpact.org/resources/the-science-of-learning/) Deans for Impact 2015
    * Super super summary of core teaching ideas
    * An invitation to think - this is not gospel

### My Notes

* Chapter 1 - Communication Breakdown Between Science and Practice in Education
    * Research == good - our intuition is often wrong
    * Old thinking should be challenged
* Chapter 2 - Different Types of Evidence in Education
    * Behavioural psychology, cognitive psychology and neuroscience are experimental disciplines
    * Blogs, books + other - should be consumed critically
* Chapter 3 - Is Intuition the Enemy of Teaching and Learning?
    * Reading easy - so must be working
    * Retrieval feels harder - so must not as effective
* Chapter 4 - Pervasive Misunderstandings about Learning: How They Arise, and What Can We Do?
    * Many myths - learning styles
    * Shaming people is not a effective way to change minds
* Chapter 5 - Perception
    * Curse of knowledge
* Chapter 6 - Attention
    * Attention is a limited resource
    * Avoid overload
    * Selective focus - switching tasks slow
    * Mind wondering can miss vital information
* Chapter 7 - Memory
    * Not like computer - use == reconstructing == strengthen
    * Not objective - imagination can become memories
    * Short term memory == 30 seconds
    * Once encoded - we rapidly start to forget
* Chapter 8 - Strategies
    * Spacing (interleaving)
    * Elaboration
    * Concrete (real) examples
    * Visuals (dual coding)
    * Retrieval
* Chapter 9 Planning learning
    * Spacing is hard to stick to schedule
* Chapter 10 Developing understanding
    * Elaborate (add features to memory) - 'How' 'Why'
    * Must be connected to pre-existing knowledge
    * Multiple concrete (real) examples
    * Duel coding - images + words
* Chapter 11 Reinforcing learning
    * Act of retrieval strengthens memory
    * Frequent low stakes quizzes
    * Any retrieval practice is good (it feels hard)
    * Avoid 'feel good' learning




### How will this affect planning our computing lessons?

* Test/Quiz == Retrieval/Recall == better learning
* Test/Quiz regularly
* Test/Quiz past topics
* Test, Test, Test, Assess, Assess, Assess, Quiz, Quiz, Quiz - use that to plan

My Take: The practical act of coding is not separate to the theory. If we are trying to manifest aspects/concepts/topics of computing in code, we are repeating/strengthening/solidifying our programming understanding.

Cognitive load theory
---------------------

* [Cognitive Load Theory and its application in the classroom](https://impact.chartered.college/article/shibli-cognitive-load-theory-classroom/) Chartered College of Teaching Journal 2020

> Dylan Wiliam tweeted on 26 January 2017 that he had ‘come to the conclusion Sweller’s Cognitive Load Theory is the single most important thing for teachers to know

Attention is a finite resource and can be depleted quickly.

> Working memory should be seen as short term and finite, 
> whereas long-term memory can be seen as infinite. 
>
> The aim should be to move knowledge to long-term memory 
> because when a student is exposed to new material, 
> they can draw on this previous knowledge and the cognitive load is reduced.
>
> However, if subject knowledge is incomplete, 
> the student is unable to fall back on the long-term memory and the working memory becomes overloaded, 
> leading to working memory failures. 
(Gathercole and Alloway, 2007),

> Be wary of reducing cognitive load too much – the learning process should be manageable, but not overly fragmented.
See Expertise Reversal Effect in [inclusion.md](./inclusion.md) - too much support cases lack of engagement and inattention


> Gesturing is a technique children use to reduce cognitive load while speaking

Help sheets or Knowledge Organisers can help reduce cognitive load

    * [Threshold Concepts in Practice](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Threshold-Concepts-Practice-Educational-Futures/dp/9463005102/) 2016
    * > These conceptual gateways are integrative, exposing the previously hidden interrelatedness of ideas, and are irreversible.
      > However they frequently present troublesome knowledge and are often points at which students become stuck. 
      > Difficulty in understanding may leave the learner in a 'liminal' state of transition, a 'betwixt and between' space of knowing and not knowing, where understanding can approximate to a form of mimicry.
      > Learners navigating such spaces report a sense of uncertainty, ambiguity, paradox, anxiety, even chaos
* Forgetting is normal - Liminal space is normal - reassure them it is normal
* Don't rush to students to 'make it right' let them grapple with the problem

* Example
    * Threshold concepts
        * If statements
        * For loops
        * Variables
        * Functions and parameters
    * Once we understand those threshold concepts, we can move on to Algorithms
    * Once we understand there are different algorithms to solve the same problem we can can deliberate which may be the most appropriate and why

TASK: What does this mean for your planning?

Teaching for Mastery
--------------------
* [Secondary Mathematics Teaching for Mastery: Some themes and key principles](https://www.ncetm.org.uk/media/q0ykgtje/secondary-teaching-for-mastery-march-2021.pdf)
    * > Lessons are designed to have a high-level of teacher-student and student-student interaction where all students 
    in the class are thinking about, working on, and discussing the same mathematical content. Challenge and the 
    opportunity to deepen understanding of the key mathematical ideas is provided for all.
    * > Every attempt is made to keep the whole class learning together. Differentiation is achieved, not through offering 
    different content, but through paying attention to the levels of support and challenge needed to allow every 
    student to fully grasp the concepts and ideas being studied.
    * > For those students who grasp ideas quickly, acceleration into new content is avoided. Instead, these students are 
    challenged by deeper analysis of the lesson content and by applying the content in new and unfamiliar problem-
    solving situations. If some students fail to grasp an important aspect of the lesson, this is identified quickly, and 
    early intervention ensures that they are ready to move forward with the whole class in the next lesson.
    * > Teachers use well-crafted examples and exercises which, through careful use of variation (including what to keep 
    the same) focuses students’ attention on the key learning point.

    * > A knowledge organiser (KO) sets out the important, useful and powerful knowledge on a topic on a single page (Kirby, 2015). With the content demands of new courses, and schools adopting a knowledge-based curriculum, these are becoming increasingly popular in schools
* [Improved Results & Workload with Knowledge Organisers](https://blog.teamsatchel.com/case-study-improving-results-and-reducing-workloads-with-knowledge-organisers-and-quizzes)
    * > “My students just keep forgetting everything - even though I’ve taught it to them over and over again!”
    * > Knowledge Organisers are an increasingly popular teaching method in schools and simply involve distilling the key information for a term’s teaching, or a topic, onto 1 side of A4 – similar to a graphic organiser.
      > This Knowledge Organiser is given to students as homework on Show My Homework with instructions for students and parents on how the students can test themselves, and how the parents can test their children, to memorise as much of the key information as possible.
* [Are knowledge organisers flawed?](https://learningspy.co.uk/psychology/are-knowledge-organisers-flawed/) David Daidu
    * > most schools don’t have self-quizzing cultures built in. Students don’t use them effectively and just copy words across blindly without self-quizzing.
      > Worse than that, the KO’s are just stuck into students’ books (or reside at the bottom of their bags) and are never looked at again. 
      > This is a waste of time, but it certainly doesn’t mean that KOs are a bad idea. All it means is that – like everything else – inventions work best when resources, practice and purpose are aligned.

    * Mistake 3 - Wasting time making it too pretty
        * form of procrastination
    * Mistake 4 – Not using Elaborative Interrogation
        * Re-reading is insufficient revision
        * "why is this true?" or "why might this be the case?"
    * Mistake 5 – Not utilising Retrieval Practice
        * they don’t actually test whether they understand what they’re written

Generative Learning
-------------------

    * > The findings suggest there isn’t a definitive answer to whether coding should be taught as a math-based skill or a language-based skill. In part, that’s because learning to program may draw on both language and multiple demand systems, even if — once learned — programming doesn’t rely on the language regions, the researchers say.

    * [Harry FletcherWood](https://twitter.com/HFletcherWood/status/1326212067917959168)
        * I have been very sceptical about growth mindset over the last few years, but a new study has substantially changed my mind
        * In research-design terms, this was bulletproof: pre-registered, randomly-assigned, teachers didn't know which students got the growth mindset intervention and analysis team didn't know the hypothesis or which group was which.
        * Students did 2 x 25-minute online activities about growth mindset: just telling them that we can get smarter (not telling them to practice).  These were conveyed using various powerful techniques (like stories from role models).
        * The impact: a) it changed students’ opinions about whether they could learn, b) lower-attaining students gained higher grades, c) students were more likely to choose more challenging maths courses the following year.
        * The intervention had less effect if the school was already effective (most students did well there), and if peer norms about achievement were negative.
        * I can't fault the study. Worth noting that this was designed by a stellar team - but it's scalable and powerful: 0.1 SD increase in GPA for an hour's intervention. So I'm having to update: growth mindset is more promising than I'd thought

Dweck is a coauthor on all three studies that show that teaching a growth mindset can improve students’ school performance. She is also not a coauthor on all of the studies that cast serious doubt on mindset theory.

        * The distance between what the learner is able to do unaided, compared to with expert or advanced peer support
        * According to Vygotsky (1978), much important learning by the child occurs through social interaction with a skillful tutor. The tutor may model behaviors and/or provide verbal instructions for the child. Vygotsky refers to this as cooperative or collaborative dialogue. 
        * Scaffolding consists of the activities provided by the educator, or more competent peer, to support the student as he or she is led through the zone of proximal development.
        * Support is tapered off (i.e. withdrawn) as it becomes unnecessary, much as a scaffold is removed from a building during construction. The student will then be able to complete the task again on his own.
        * Scaffolding vs. Discovery Learning
            * Freund (1990) wanted to investigate if children learn more effectively via Piaget's concept of discovery learning or by guided learning via the ZPD.

            * Assess the learner's current knowledge and experience for the academic content
            * Relate content to what students already understand or can do

    * Active
        * Pupils should be actively engaged in their learning – typically this will be doing something on a computer, but it could also be taking part in a discussion or an activity away from the computer, such as role-play to illustrate how packets of data travel across the internet.
    * Constructive
        * This can be understood both in the sense of constructing meaning, developing pupils’ mental model of computation and technologies, and in the sense of making something, whether this is a computer program, a presentation or a blog post.
    * Intentional
        * Ideally, pupils should have some degree of choice over how they tackle a task or project, or perhaps even over the task or project itself. It is unlikely they will learn much from copying a worked solution off an IWB screen, and many projects can be constructed or adapted to allow plenty of scope for individual creativity.
    * Authentic
        * Wherever possible, try to link activities with pupils’ own experiences, both within and beyond school: cross-curricular projects work very well, as do those linked to the life of the school itself, or to pupils’ experiences of technology.
    * Cooperative
        * Computing, in both industrial and academic contexts, is a collaborative endeavour. Where possible, construct activities so that pupils can work together, supporting one another in their learning

Closing Thoughts
----------------

* Knowledge is always built on previous knowledge
    * As a teacher - if you are aware of the actual previous knowledge (and not just because _you've covered_ it) you can create meaningful sequence
* As a learner - If you're not aware of your knowledge gaps, you assume you don't have them
    * Recall and Evaluation are key
* Train students to check their own knowledge and train them to check each others knowledge
* Idea: Ask students to 'Describe a concept with a picture/diagram/visual/mime'. great retrieval practice

Feedback:
* You are now on your way to become professional educations.
* Given the material I have just introduced you to, how could this online 3 hours could have been constructed to cement these concepts in more detail? More active learning? how? was it appropriate to introduce you to these topics and allow you to explore them?

    * > 159 Norwegian schools over four years. The intervention includes students aged 7-9 and consists of pulling students from their regular mathematics classes into small, homogenous groups for mathematics instruction for 3 to 4 hours per week, for two periods of 4-6 weeks per school year.
    * (ave 10 weeks with 3.5 hours per week = 35 hours of small group intervention)
    * > All students, not only struggling students, are pulled out. We find that students in treatment schools increased their performance in mathematics by `.16` standard deviations at the end of the school year and by `.06` standard deviations in national tests 1-2 years later, with no differential effect by pre-ability level or gender.
    * [Explained: Sigma](https://news.mit.edu/2012/explained-sigma-0209) - How do you know when a new finding is significant? The sigma value can tell you — but watch out for dead fish.
        * > One standard deviation, or one sigma, plotted above or below the average value on that normal distribution curve, would define a region that includes 68 percent of all the data points. Two sigmas above or below would include about 95 percent of the data ...
    * Given how much small group (or individual) interventions cost in teacher/professional time. Is `.16` and `.06` significant?
    * Conclusion: Small group intervention is not effective given it's cost
