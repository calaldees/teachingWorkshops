* [A Theory of Applied Mind of Programming](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3304221.3325596) 2019 ongoing PhD - Understanding the challenges in learning to program 
    * > Solving problems with computing is complex and multidisciplinary
    * > Learning models typically focus on knowledge acquisition, but in programming knowledge must be applied to problem-solving
    * > Programming is an artificial construct driven by many symbols, the programming language, but often  with an invisible result that makes developing  mental models of action and abstract images challenging


Theory to Practice
------------------

All of this theory is useful. To make it have real world application in your teaching, you should always be thinking:

"With this theory ... When I am planning a lesson I will ..."

What ... so what ... now what

* After each theory chunk
    * What does this mean for your computing planning?
    * Write your reflections - discuss in pairs after each segment?

If you don't "say it", "write it" or "do it": you've probably not learnt it to any degree of fluency

Is Intuition the Enemy of Teaching and Learning?
* Reading easy - so must be working
* Retrieval feels harder - so must not as effective

If I talk at you, that may feel easy. All the great knowledge going at you. But is it effective.

* This session: Masters level free-form theory deep dive brawl.
* You explore a range of theories. Keep discussing "what is this, what does this mean for my teaching"
* Stockpile a range of reference amo for academic writing

Have the [Computing National Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study#key-stage-3) to hand and in the back of your mind

### Why Don’t Students Like School

* Article [Why Don’t Students Like School](https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/periodicals/WILLINGHAM%282%29.pdf) Wilingham 2009- as featured in American Educator
    * Full Book [Why Don′t Students Like School?: A Cognitive Scientist Answers Questions About How the Mind Works and What It Means for the Classroom](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-Don′t-Students-Like-School/dp/1119715660/) 2nd Edition June 2021 - 1st Edition Feb 2010

    * My Notes
        * Teachers are _success's_ of the education _system/process_ and enjoy learning
        * > (teachers are) dejected when they find that some of their pupils don’t like school much
        * > ... teachers should reconsider how they encourage their students to think in order to maximize the likelihood that students will get the pleasurable rush that comes from successful thought
        * > our brains are designed not for thought, but for the avoidance of thought
        * > Most of the problems you face are ones you’ve solved before, so you just do what you’ve done in the past
        * > Using memory doesn’t require much of your attention, so you are free to daydream
        * > Working on a problem with no sense that you’re making progress is not pleasurable. In fact, it’s frustrating. And there’s not great pleasure in simply knowing the answer either.
        * > (people) quickly evaluate how much mental work it will take to solve the problem. If it’s too much or too little, people stop working on the problem
        * > successful thinking relies on four factors: 
          >   1. information from the environment,
          >   2. facts in long-term memory,
          >   3. procedures in long-term memory,
          >   4. and space in working memory.
          >
          > If any one of them is inadequate, thinking will likely fail. 
        * > scan each lesson plan with an eye toward the cognitive work that students will be doing. How often does such work occur? Is it intermixed with cognitive breaks? When you have identified the challenges, consider whether they are open to negative outcomes
        * > Respect Students’ Limited Knowledge and Space in Working Memory
        * > what the key question for that lesson might be, and how you can frame that question so that it will be of the right level of difficulty to engage your students
        * > (some students) are behind the others; giving them work that is beyond them is unlikely to help them catch up,
        * > you must first be sure that they believe that they can improve, and next you must try to persuade them that it will be worth it
        * Praise the process they tackled the task with
            * _Poor test results_ == you didn't put in the time
        * > do your slower students really know how to study?
        * > Catching Up Is the Long-Term goal ... to catch up, slower students must work harder than the brighter students.
        * > their _important teacher_ set high standards and believed that they could meet those standards.
        * > be wary of praising second-rate work

    * > Cognitive science principles of learning can have a real impact on rates of learning in the classroom. There is value in teachers having working knowledge of cognitive science principles.
    * > The evidence for the application of cognitive science principles in everyday classroom conditions (applied cognitive science) is limited, with uncertainties and gaps about the applicability of specific principles across subjects and age ranges.
        * e.g Dual coding not used effectively
    * > Applying the principles of cognitive science is harder than knowing the principles and one does not necessarily follow from the other. Principles do not determine specific teaching and learning strategies or approaches to implementation. Considering how cognitive science principles are implemented in the classroom is critical.

### How will this affect planning our computing lessons?

* Test/Quiz == Retrieval/Recall == better learning
* Test/Quiz regularly
* Test/Quiz past topics
* Test, Test, Test, Assess, Assess, Assess, Quiz, Quiz, Quiz - use that to plan

My Take: The practical act of coding is not separate to the theory. If we are trying to manifest aspects/concepts/topics of computing in code, we are repeating/strengthening/solidifying our programming understanding.

Reading Code is not analogous to Reading
----------------------------------------

* [To the brain, reading computer code is not the same as reading language](https://news.mit.edu/2020/brain-reading-computer-code-1215) 2020 - Neuroscientists find that interpreting code activates a general-purpose brain network, but not language-processing centers.
    * > The findings suggest there isn’t a definitive answer to whether coding should be taught as a math-based skill or a language-based skill. In part, that’s because learning to program may draw on both language and multiple demand systems, even if — once learned — programming doesn’t rely on the language regions, the researchers say.

    * [Harry FletcherWood](https://twitter.com/HFletcherWood/status/1326212067917959168)
        * I have been very sceptical about growth mindset over the last few years, but a new study has substantially changed my mind
        * In research-design terms, this was bulletproof: pre-registered, randomly-assigned, teachers didn't know which students got the growth mindset intervention and analysis team didn't know the hypothesis or which group was which.
        * Students did 2 x 25-minute online activities about growth mindset: just telling them that we can get smarter (not telling them to practice).  These were conveyed using various powerful techniques (like stories from role models).
        * The impact: a) it changed students’ opinions about whether they could learn, b) lower-attaining students gained higher grades, c) students were more likely to choose more challenging maths courses the following year.
        * The intervention had less effect if the school was already effective (most students did well there), and if peer norms about achievement were negative.
        * I can't fault the study. Worth noting that this was designed by a stellar team - but it's scalable and powerful: 0.1 SD increase in GPA for an hour's intervention. So I'm having to update: growth mindset is more promising than I'd thought
* Growth Mindset does not work
    * [Is growth mindset bollocks?](https://learningspy.co.uk/psychology/growth-mindset-bollocks/)

        * > Then I discovered the one characteristic that the studies that support mindset theory share and that all the studies that contradict the theory lack: Carol Dweck. Dweck is a coauthor on all three studies that show that teaching a growth mindset can improve students’ school performance. She is also not a coauthor on all of the studies that cast serious doubt on mindset theory.

It asks what should they do with instruction ... to really make sense of it and lean in a way that allows them to apply it to new situations in the future

Closing Thoughts
----------------

* Knowledge is always built on previous knowledge
    * As a teacher - if you are aware of the actual previous knowledge (and not just because _you've covered_ it) you can create meaningful sequence
* As a learner - If you're not aware of your knowledge gaps, you assume you don't have them
    * Recall and Evaluation are key
* Train students to check their own knowledge and train them to check each others knowledge
* Idea: Ask students to 'Describe a concept with a picture/diagram/visual/mime'. great retrieval practice
    * interpretive dance (fun teacher demo)

Feedback:
* You are now on your way to become professional educations.
* Given the material I have just introduced you to, how could this online 3 hours could have been constructed to cement these concepts in more detail? More active learning? how? was it appropriate to introduce you to these topics and allow you to explore them?

        * According to Vygotsky (1978), much important learning by the child occurs through social interaction with a skillful tutor. The tutor may model behaviors and/or provide verbal instructions for the child. Vygotsky refers to this as cooperative or collaborative dialogue. 
        * Scaffolding consists of the activities provided by the educator, or more competent peer, to support the student as he or she is led through the zone of proximal development.
        * Support is tapered off (i.e. withdrawn) as it becomes unnecessary, much as a scaffold is removed from a building during construction. The student will then be able to complete the task again on his own.

Small group interventions - are they effective?
-----------------------------------------------

See EEF findings

    * > 159 Norwegian schools over four years. The intervention includes students aged 7-9 and consists of pulling students from their regular mathematics classes into small, homogenous groups for mathematics instruction for 3 to 4 hours per week, for two periods of 4-6 weeks per school year.
    * (ave 10 weeks with 3.5 hours per week = 35 hours of small group intervention)
    * > All students, not only struggling students, are pulled out. We find that students in treatment schools increased their performance in mathematics by `.16` standard deviations at the end of the school year and by `.06` standard deviations in national tests 1-2 years later, with no differential effect by pre-ability level or gender.

Principles Summary
----------

* Internation Academy of Education - Education Practices Series - [How children learn](https://www.iaoed.org/downloads/prac07e.pdf) Stella Vosniadou - 
    1. Active Involvement
        * Learning requires the active, constructive involvement of the learner.
    2.  Social participation
        * Learning is primarily a social activity and participation in the social life of the school is central for learning to occur
    3. Meaningful activities 
        * People learn best when they participate in activities that are perceived to be useful in real life and are culturally relevant.
    4. Relating new information to prior knowledge
        * New knowledge is constructed on the basis of what is already understood and believed
    5. Being strategic
        * People learn by employing effective and flexible strategies that help them to understand, reason, memorize and solve problems
    6.  Engaging in self-regulation and being reflective
        * Learners must know how to plan and monitor their learning, how to set their own learning goals and how to correct errors
    7. Restructuring prior knowledge
        * Sometimes prior knowledge can stand in the way of learning something new. Students must learn how to solve internal inconsistencies and restructure existing conceptions when necessary
    8. Aiming towards understanding rather than memorization
        * Learning is better when material is organized around general principles and explanations, rather than when it is based on the memorization of isolated facts and procedures
    9. Helping students learn to transfer
        * Learning becomes more meaningful when the lessons are applied to real-life situations
    10. Taking time to practice
        * Learning is a complex cognitive activity that cannot be rushed. It requires considerable time and periods of practice to start building expertise in an area
    11. Developmental and individual differences
        * Children learn best when their individual differences are taken into consideration
    12.  Creating motivated learners
        * Learning is critically influenced by learner motivation. Teachers can help students become more motivated learners by their behaviour and the statements they make
