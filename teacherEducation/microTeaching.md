Microteaching
=============

* [Microteaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microteaching)
    * > used in teachers’ pre-service education to train them systematically by allowing them to experiment main teacher behaviors
    * > reciprocal negotiation of the students actively presenting and watching about the performances can make great contribution to the acquisition of the skills (Taşdemir, 2006)
    * > Video recordings provide pre-service teachers with the chance of evaluating themselves by engaging them in more experiences and configurations (Jensen et al., 1994)


Task
----

* You are to plan and deliver 20 min computing lesson to the group as if we were KS3 or KS4 students
* The lesson can be any topic of computing in KS3 or KS4
* We will present in a Blackboard Collaborate session
* We will then discuss/comment on the lesson (10min)

Direction was deliberately light to facilitate
* The selection of a strong/comfortable topic
* The freedom to choose allocation of time, trial ideas, trial technologies


Spirit of the exercise
----------------------

* An open explorative experiment
    * We are not looking for polished lessons or skills
    * This may be the first time any of you have delivered a lesson
    * It is a REALLY scary experience
* Recordings/Observations are normal practice throughout your carrier
    * I review and reflect on recordings of my own sessions
        * Members of my teaching department review session recordings
        * Members of my teaching department may join our sessions in future to observe my practice
    * This ongoing transparency is normal and is done to help everyone grow
        * For your own piece of mind and sanity, try to embrace this concept whole heartedly
* This _online only_ experience is less than ideal - but is still useful


Possible ideas to look out for
------------------------------

Not all presentations will cover all of these points.

* Topic cleanly identified
    * Linked to other parts of curriculum?
* Theories used
    * Duel coding? Rosenshine? Cognative Load?
* Tools used for engagement?
* Active participation?
* Assessment?
    * Does the teacher know the information has been interpreted correctly?
    * Questions? Online-Quiz? Task outcome?


Task - Postmortem
-----------------

Download/Save your own recording - this will be deleted this weekend.

Watch your own recording back.
Identify
* 3 things you did well
* 3 action points for you to action

It could be interesting to refer to this recoding again at the end of the course to see the difference.


Random order
------------

```python
import random
names = ['bob', 'jane', 'sally']
print(names.pop(random.randrange(len(names))))
```
