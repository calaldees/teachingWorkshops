Task 4 â€“ Counting Word Occurrences in a string (Challenge!)
Ask the user to enter a sentence and then a word. The program is to return the number of times the word is present in the sentence as a complete word. Ignore case. The sentence will end with a full stop, and this should not be part of the word.
