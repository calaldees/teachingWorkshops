Frameworks and Languages
========================

Frameworks for what?

AWS Lambda?
    SMTP in lambda
Crypto processing


Containers for trialling technologies
Kubenettes?

Docker would be difficult to run at a user level on campus

Server Side
-----------

### DIY HTTP Server

Java + Python

### DIY Message Board

Python + PHP

### Dynamic Server Frameworks

DB, Templates, Routing

CGI-BIN - write a script in any labnagueg as long as it printed html response
PHP lowered barrier to entry to server - get people started

Wordpress - Framework? Lots of plugs
No other frameworks at the time

CodIgnitor PHP - Laravell (new) PHP
Node.js
Rails (Ruby)
Falcon

Shimmi - own framework - 
v1 hardcoded for one use - image board - could not do anything else with it
v2 others interested but wanted differnt features - started plugings - made a minimum engine. Everything was a plugin that spoke to each other. Event system page event kicks it off - login plugin

Assessment
----------

Create a prototype of one of the following web services
buggy and held together with sticky-tape
Do not need to implement any user security

I strongly advise you to use different frameworks, languages and projects.

* SocialMedia (Twitter/Facebook)
* eCommerce (Amazon) - list products, add to basket
* Video Streaming (Netflix, iPlayer, Youtube) - browse thumbnails/search, player video
* Blog with multiple authors (Medium) - list articles, rss, images in content
* Chat/Messenger (WhatsApp) - multiple users
* Mail?
* Messageboard?
* Collection tracker - valuation
* Other - welcome to discuss

Justify your choice of frameworks - server client
github project
Runnable in containers - kubenetees?
Must have automated tests to prove it's functionality - see test results/progress - instuctions for viewing tests
pofetionaly deplyable - externally hosted
useable on both desktop and mobile device

30% fragments
40% something works
50% frameworks used
60% tests range of framework features used
70% deployable substantial framework features used
80% works on range of devices
90% can function with 50+ users, externally visible

Some aforementioned links:

Client side:
https://preactjs.com/
https://mithril.js.org/  <- pretty fringe
https://vuejs.org/        <- pretty popular

Server side:

https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/

I haven't used Fast API in production, but it looks well thought out and brings together some previously disparate tooling.
Sanic is essentially like Flask in that it's up to you to decide a lot of things.
