Do not need to implement any user security

I strongly advise you to use different frameworks, languages and projects.

* SocialMedia (Twitter/Facebook)
* eCommerce (Amazon) - list products, add to basket
* Video Streaming (Netflix, iPlayer, Youtube) - browse thumbnails/search, player video
* Blog with multiple authors (Medium) - list articles, rss, images in content
* Chat/Messenger (WhatsApp) - multiple users
* Mail?
* Messageboard?
* Collection tracker - valuation
* Other - welcome to discuss

Justify your choice of frameworks - server client
github project
Runnable in containers - kubenetees?
Must have automated tests to prove it's functionality - see test results/progress - instuctions for viewing tests
pofetionaly deplyable - externally hosted
useable on both desktop and mobile device

30% fragments
40% something works
50% frameworks used
60% tests range of framework features used
70% deployable substantial framework features used
80% works on range of devices
90% can function with 50+ users, externally visible
Lambda
