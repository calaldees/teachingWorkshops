Assessment
----------

Create a prototype of one of the following web services
buggy and held together with sticky-tape
Do not need to implement any user security

I strongly advise you to use different frameworks, languages and projects.

* SocialMedia (Twitter/Facebook)
* eCommerce (Amazon) - list products, add to basket
* Video Streaming (Netflix, iPlayer, Youtube) - browse thumbnails/search, player video
* Blog with multiple authors (Medium) - list articles, rss, images in content
* Chat/Messenger (WhatsApp) - multiple users
* Mail?
* Messageboard?
* Collection tracker - valuation
* Other - welcome to discuss

Justify your choice of frameworks - server client
github project
Runnable in containers - kubenetees?
Must have automated tests to prove it's functionality - see test results/progress - instuctions for viewing tests
pofetionaly deplyable - externally hosted
useable on both desktop and mobile device

30% fragments
40% something works
50% frameworks used
60% tests range of framework features used
70% deployable substantial framework features used
80% works on range of devices
90% can function with 50+ users, externally visible

Client side:

https://mithril.js.org/  <- pretty fringe
https://vuejs.org/        <- pretty popular

Server side:

I haven't used Fast API in production, but it looks well thought out and brings together some previously disparate tooling.
Sanic is essentially like Flask in that it's up to you to decide a lot of things.
