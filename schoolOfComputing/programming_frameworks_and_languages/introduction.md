Module Overview
---------------

## Module Aims
To develop the studentâ€™s understanding of the fundamental concepts of Programming Frameworks and Languages. 
This module supports the Implement and Operate elements of the CDIO model.

### Intended Learning Outcomes 
By the end of the module students should be able to:
1. Demonstrate an understanding of the concept of a Framework in general, a Framework used for Programming, and a Framework used for software Testing
2. Critically evaluate the effectiveness of a particular framework for an application and platform
3. Synthesise a small digital artefact using a well-formed programming framework

Whiteboard in half:
* What is a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)?
* What is a [software framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework)?

The sign of an armature:
> _TECH_XYZ_ is rubbish
This module will help develop an important part of your professional skill-set: 
> The ability to discuss and reason about technology choices

### How will we learn

1. Focus on a business engineering problem with real industry tools
    * Hand on each week with a range of tools
2. Discussion
    * Real researchers and engineers can discuss/reason about technology

#### Level 6
* Level 4 - You are told what to do
* Level 5 - Supported developing competency in a range of problem domains
* Level 6 - You are able to self direct

My role is NOT to have all the answers. 
My role is to facilitate your transition towards a skilled professional.

#### Online/Campus

* 2 weeks online
    * Blackboard
* 2 weeks on campus
    * 09:00 - 13:00 Lab (if we can fit in one room)
    * 14:00 - 18:00 (optional lab support)
